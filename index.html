Film(Before the Flood)- In the film, I was reminded of times when I have personally seen people attacking Leonardo DiCaprio for standing up for the climate crisis, especially on fox news. In my own life I have debated for countless hours the same ideas that DiCaprio is trying to get across in the film. I believed that DiCaprio is a very good ambassador for the cause of the climate crisis. I wish more people of influence were able to take a stand as he is. I also know from previous knowledge that DiCaprio is a vegan. This is not only great for his health, however it is also a testament to his dedication to the environment. Most people will claim they “care” about the environment, but still don't make the switch to a plant based diet. DiCaprio is the real deal when it comes to not only wanting change, but being the change you want to see. He not only talks the talk, but also walks the walk.  I was also taken aback at how bad the pollution has already begun to affect China. However, I am also not surprised that China is the #1 polluter, as they lack enforcement of regulations. The personal stories that DiCaprio portrays are very interesting and help put a human face of the victims of climate change. The segment that exposed the palm oil industry was also very informative. Many products that people love include palm oil, including the vastly popular nutella. Even now people are consuming nutella on the mass level. People need to wake up and realize the implications of their diet and what they put in their body. As the film progressed it began to highlight the disgusting beef industry. Beef is horrible for the environment, not only does it require a mass amount of resources per calorie. It also encompasses the most for the amount of methane in the environment. I hope most people watching this film make the connection regarding palm oil and beef into their personal diet. I really enjoyed the part with Elon Musk. He is truly a revolutionary in the technology that is going to aid mankind in transitioning away from fossil fuels. The idea of a carbon tax is very good, I was surprised that Obama did not campaign for a carbon tax and was even more surprised  when I found out he at one time was anti-gay marriage. The Paris agreement is good in nature, but it is sad that there are no penalties. I was surprised by the Pope making a direct message regarding climate change. Hopefully this resonates with religious people in positions of power. This film did a great job of hitting all the bases off the causes and future implications of climate change. I hope the audience makes the connection between the film, and what they can do in their own lives to bring about change.

The lecture s accurate in the idea that alot of people may not want to know the truth. I think this is a major problem. A high percent of people will just never click the video, they dont care. Then another percentage will watch the video, but rationalize their current lifestyle. It is a very small percentage that will watch the video and take action. I believe the film was a great intro to the issue, however more in-depth environmental films could also be useful in adjunct.

I too agree with you that Ken's lecture accurately depicted that most people deny the truth regarding climate change and their contributions. When watching the film I was disgusted to hear that fossil fuel companies pay off government officials and people in high media to disguise the realities of climate change with innaccurate media depictions. I personally believe the carbon tax would be extremely beneficial as it would cause lower levels of carbon being realized into the atmosphere. While I think it would help I believe it would take a large amount of time to gain participation of enough countries to establish a change when it comes to carbon emission. When I heard about the forest fire emissions released in the Indonesian fires I was appalled at the lack of disrespect the earth receives when it comes down to money. Creating punishments whether monetarily or legally I personally believe would create regulations on the corrupt fossil fuel companies that bribe mass media and majorly influential figures into deceiving the public for money.
<br><br>
I too agree that the film does a great job showing the causes and future implications of climate change as they have believers speaking the truth and how they feel and are affected on the daily by overpowering, corrupted countries. I enjoyed how DiCaprio transitioned from one place to another and each place built off of the rising concerns from the previous location. Watching how it affected the filming of his own movie was a perfect addition to the realities of global warming and how it largely affects all those who cause global warming the least. I was in awe of how well DiCaprio presented his speech as the UN Messenger of Peace. His presentation so accurately described the excruciating reality of all the places he had traveled to and then depicted future prophesies that the world should take in order to assist in slowing down the inevitable destruction of this earth.
<br><hr>
Film comments:  I agree Decaprio was the perfect ambassador for the climate crisis film.  He had previous experience but wanted to learn more.  He also worked hard to travel the world and learn about the different issues, narrating and doing emotional interviews with people of all types.  I also was not surprised that China was the number one cause of pollution.  I found the section on the solar businessman in china very interesting.  It seems that would be a great market to appeal to for those products.  
<br><br>

The use of different locations and different cultures helped keep me engaged with the film.  The imagery of the ice caps and the device that was supposed to be buried under layers of ice was a very powerful use of imagery.  It was a great way to show the magnitude of the impact that the climate crisis is having on the earth.
<br><hr>
While I agree that DiCaprio worked hard to travel the world for this film, we should be reminded that this travel adds to DiCaprio's carbon footprint. What I was more impressed with was that, to stick to his words, they actually paid a carbon tax to produce this film. They avoided hypocrisy. The makers of this film lead as an example for big businesses who should pay for their carbon emissions. I agree with the film when it states that taxes will deter Americans from continuing to excessively emit carbon dioxide. 
<br><br>

I resonated with what the woman from India had to say about us Americans. She was essentially calling us out in saying that if we want India to work on their carbon footprint we should reduce our own. I do believe that other nations look to us as an example. We set the world stage and if we are able to effectively curb our emissions then others can too. Some people look at this problem with such anxiety because it does seem overwhelming. Some countries don't know an effective course of action but if we came up with a plan that worked I think others would be more inclined to follow.
<br><hr>

I, too, found it interesting and honorable that DiCaprio, while producing the documentary to call attention to the severity of the climate crisis, was able to acknowledge that even this film had created its own individual carbon footprint, and further provide a settlement for such. It seems to me that DiCaprio was a fitting guide for viewers to truly understand the extent of the situation, as the ethos provided by his recognizable and popular acting career coupled with the logos supported by his obvious background in the topic allowed for a compelling and informative unravelment of the climate issue. Similar to DiCaprio, I was quite shocked and deeply saddened to see such utter destruction of countless environmental aspects, and was specifically disturbed to hear of the complete ruination of many once-thriving and full-of-life coral reefs. To understand that around 50% of all coral reefs have been destroyed is only one example of the unexcusable detriments mentioned in the film.
<br><br>

The concept that left me most disheartened was the idea that some people from past generations not only disbelieved in the existence of climate change but further sought to convince others of its (false) nonexistence, solely for the purpose of monetary gain. If fossil fuel companies had not acted so selfishly in the past by encouraging the idea that climate change is a hoax, steps may have been taken previously to prevent such current and future dire situations. Fortunately for these past generations, however, the planet still has a fighting chance if immediate remedial action is taken.

<br><hr>
The more I watch films and read articles on what contributes to the climate crisis, the more I realize there is so much I don’t know. Watching “Before the Flood” forced me to contemplate if people really know the damage being inflicted on the earth, and why that damage is occurring. Although Leonardo DiCaprio does not have scientific background on climate change, he is still putting in as much effort as he can to create acknowledgement on the situation. As a popular figure of today, he is using his influence to raise public awareness that is much needed. 
<br><br>

However, I agree that it is quite hypocritical of DiCaprio to extend his carbon footprint while filming. I feel that he really wants to spark change in the United States and around the globe, but the truth is, individuals who actually have influence to begin projects to challenge climate change would rather push that thought to the side. These people include politicians and companies who benefit from the usage of fossil fuels. 
<br><br>

When DiCaprio was speaking to the Indian woman, he seemed much less educated than her. She presented several key facts that he could not counter. With this, I believe this film failed to present deeper solutions and actions Americans could take to counter climate change, and hopefully make a difference. The woman’s comparison to the average amount of energy one American uses to those of other countries really puts into perspective how Americans are truly putting the climate crisis on the backburner. Forests are purposely being burned to create palm oil plantations, and the oil produced is found in countless everyday consumer items (cosmetics, food, detergents, etc). Not only does this release massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, but prime resources that will help us restabilize the climate are being taken away as well. What humans do in their everyday lives such as eating beef and packaged ramen are affecting the environment in disastrous ways. Companies only care about the revenue they bring in, but at one point, the damage of climate change will cost Americans trillions of dollars. I truly agree that a carbon tax would be beneficial due to humans being one of the biggest factors of climate change. A carbon tax as well as less tax on environmentally friendly items would shift several factors of human consumption and consumerism.  
<br><br>

Quotes that stuck with me from the film:
<br><br>
“What we’ve done to the rest of the world is criminal.” 
<br><br>
“We’ve reversed half a billion years of evolution.”
<br><hr>
I completely agree on grounds of talking the talk and walking the walk in terms of how DiCaprio spreads his message. I am a vegan myself and when it comes to climate change, people are often more interested in "thoughts and prayers" rather than actually making a lifestyle change. I can absolutely appreciate that someone who is so well known is also doing whatever he can to spread the message of climate change; I wish that other influential people would follow in his footsteps. 

<br><br>

I also thought that the film did a great job of highlighting the impacts of climate change and industry on a world scale. Not only do we get to see the impacts of sea level rise, but also air pollution and deforestation and more. I think that this approach highlights that different communities will be affected in different ways, but that climate change and the continuation of certain human behaviors (ie burning fossil fuels, consuming animal products, consuming palm oil, etc.) is a threat to everyone everywhere. I also thought that this film did a really good job of showing how devastating a lot of human behaviors are on our environment, by showing tar sands, mining operations, etc.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you on how the majority of people are still trying to ignore the issue of climate change by shoving it aside and pretending that it never existed. Even among the representatives and senators in the U.S. Congress, there are many deniers of climate change who claim that it never really existed. It is possible that they might know that climate change is true but they still are reluctant to acknowledge the truth of it, fearing that they would lose the sponsorship and money supplied from the big fossil fuel and industrial-focused companies. It is quite an unfortunate phenomenon in our modern society that politicians would rather place the citizens of this planet at risk by spreading misinformation on the invalidity of climate change just because of the money provided by the fossil fuel companies than being truthful and honest to themselves and recognizing the occurrence and impacts of climate change. 
<br><br>

I also agree that this film has provided a wonderful introduction to the problem of climate change because of its expository nature and that it exposes the audience to the real-time, realistic negative consequences of climate change in certain parts of the world, further proving that climate change is not a "hoax" as claimed by its deniers but rather an urgent issue requiring immediate, drastic changes and solutions. Besides, I am moved by DiCaprio's determination and persistence in learning about climate change knowing that he does not know much about it and that he is an active advocate for environmental protection and an environmentalist despite his fame and influences. Lastly, as many have mentioned before, I also want to comment on the end of the film where it stated that the crew for this film had voluntarily paid carbon tax for the ecological footprint from the production of this film. This action has really shown to the audience that this is truly an environmentalist film with the goal of protecting our environment in mind because the film crew is taking real actions and doing their fair share and contributing their own efforts to save our planet.


<br><hr>
I also agree that DiCaprio is a great ambassador for the climate crisis. His knowledge of and dedication to the cause makes him a good role model. Moreover, I believe his following as an actor and his popularity as a celebrity makes him an even better ambassador! Most people do not care about global warming. Some do not even know anything about it. By becoming an ambassador, DiCaprio is creating a bridge between the Environment and the film industry. He is connecting something crucial to life with something that intrigues pretty much everyone! Therefore, he can use his passion and fame to attract people who otherwise wouldn't be interested in the climate change! Education is the number one step to saving the planet, and that is what he is accomplishing.
<br><hr>
That point is valid that DiCaprio did extend his carbon footprint through the creation of this film. However the hope is that through educating the public and curving the carbon footprint of the millions of people who will watch the film, the film at the end of the day would result in a net negative carbon footprint. The reduced carbon footprint of viewers most definitely outweighs the production.
<br><hr>
In addition, the film also raised a point that some groups of people deny the scientific conclusion about global warming made by scientists and refuse to take any action to prevent global warming.
<br><hr>
When I first started watching the film, I also began to think of all the times DiCaprio has been ridiculed for standing up for an issue that he didn't really understand. However, as I came to watch the film, I truly began to realize the multi-dimensional knowledge he has gathered on the topic through the most effective method of talking to experts in the field. I also admire that DiCaprio understands the issue and acknowledges that his pessimism and prior lack of in depth knowledge may have led the UN to choose the wrong guy. After this film, I don't think they did. I didn't know that DiCaprio is vegan and therefore isn't just preaching, but is doing himself. 
<br><br>


The parts of the film that were the most eye-opening for me was the talk DiCaprio had with Sunita Narain. I think she had a lot of good points when she said that many western developed countries look to developing countries like India to suggest a sentiment like "don't go to fossil fuels, so straight to solar". It is a very ignorant comment for these countries to make, as Sunita points out, if it was so easy to make the jump, why haven't they done it in the first place. Also,  I thought President Obama's approach of framing global warming as a national security issue is good because I think it appeals to many people who may not have cared about this issue before. By putting it in terms of "this will harm your safety" in a more apparent matter and involving an institution like the Pentagon was a very creative outlook on climate change. I also think that having segments with the Pope and Elon Musk (and others from a variety of industries) were really interesting because it shows viewers that this is an issue that unites us all. 
<br><br>


I think many people do not want to watch a film like this because it is quite depressing and leaves many feeling stuck. While there is an effort to be hopeful, I had trouble believing there really is hope because I just don't see our country's leaders becoming convinced and stepping out of the greed that restricts them. Even though I feel pretty disappointed and stuck myself, I'm glad I watched this film and learned about climate change in a lot more detail that I knew before.
<br><hr>
I am in complete agreement with you. I admired DiCaprio for using his fame and fortune as an actor to try and make a difference in the world, although he knew he would obviously receive blatant criticism for voicing his opinion on the topic of climate change, as depicted by the clips of folks like Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck. I think it is very powerful when a person who isn't a part of the UN, or other environmental protection agency/group speaks out because it allows more people to be opening to hearing what they have to say. It is too easy to tune out of the climate change conversation if you think the person has a bias. I agreed with Sunita Narain as well, mainly in her point that the US is a leading example for the entire world, and it is the responsibility of our leaders and citizens to do whatever we can to implement/test/follow policies to hopefully reduce the damages we are causing the planet, so that other countries can follow along as well. (It was shocking to hear that the average American is responsible for climate change 50% more than the next country France, and something like 60x the amount that someone from Africa is.) If there is one thing that can unite everyone on the planet, it's the planet itself. We all have that one common factor, and I think the more attention we can bring to this issue, the better our planet will be as a whole, irrespective of the actual climate itself. 
<br><br>


The film was somewhat depressing, but I believe just like watching videos of slaughterhouses exposing the realities of the meat industry, everyone needs to be exposed to the reality of what is happening to our planet because of actions we are taking. I am eager to learn more ways that we as individuals can not only bring attention to the topic of climate change, but do something ourselves to help reverse damages we have done to the environment.<br><hr>

I agree wholeheartedly with the focus of this comment on the use of influential figures in response to the climate crisis and to political issues in general. Using one’s position of power in order to inform others of issues close to their hearts is, what I believe, a necessary part of fame and power. This should be considered somewhat of responsibility for those in power, using influence for good is exactly what was outlined in this documentary, not only by DiCaprio but by the others featured, including Barack Obama, Elon Musk, and the Pope. All of these men are leaders in some sense of the word, whether that be political, religious, in the media, or in one’s field of expertise. I believe they use this leadership for good by participating in this film and that the diverse backgrounds and areas of influence that they each come from increases the impact of the film as a whole. As stated in the above comment, I do believe that acting as you ask others to is essential in making a difference as a leader. 
 <br><br>
The focus of the above comment on the beef industry as well as DiCaprio’s choice to live as a vegan is an important takeaway from the documentary and its impact.  Being a vegetarian myself, I have firsthand experience as to how individual sacrifices can be difficult and thus I commend DiCaprio’s efforts to support a cause that he believes so strongly in. The difficulty of these individual sacrifices gives an interesting perspective to the answer to the question, if you could know the truth about the climate crisis would you want to? This is because the answer may lead to solutions that will be both difficult for someone on an individual level and thus seem hopeless when applied to a global scale. Despite these concerns, I feel as though the film did a great job both addressing these concerns and portraying the issue drastically enough to make the concerns seem small in comparison.
<br><hr>


The film(before the flood) also brought in a lot new interesting things that I didn’t know about the climate crisis. Some of the things I do on a day to day could be cut out of my routine in order to leave a smaller carbon footprint. New Years resolution: cut my carbon footprint to as low as I possibly can. The one things that did get me frustrated was the blatant corruption that festers in our political system. As highlighted in the movie the fossil fuel industry continually lobby and funds so many of our politicians. It really makes you feel insignificant with what little you have trying to go against such powerful forces. However I’m sure there’s more of us than them which is comforting. Since it is an election year it is a good time to put our efforts to the test and elect leaders who are committed to protecting our planet and with the powerful forces at play we will need radical change radical leadership and a strong movement to help us win in this unprecedented time.
<br><hr>
When it comes to the idea of being vegan you are spot on!  The film opens up with one of my favorite paintings,  The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch.  This painting has been interpreted in many ways, but it clearly shows the deterioration of the earth from purity to destruction caused by the seven deadly sins.  In this scenario I believe we can draw a connection between the sin of Gluttony to our current consumption of meat products and processed foods.  People who eat meat act in gluttonous ways by wasting so much potential plant food and arable land so they can eat meat.  This is a huge waste of resources that is destroying our planet.  In the film DiCaprio  investigates the palm oil industry and shows how destructive it is. Even though though this is available information, people still consume it on a daily basis.  We need to radically change our behavior, and economically support companies that are trying to make an entirely plant based diet feasible for all Americans to achieve. 
 <br><br>


It was very interesting to see how all of these major public figures approach climate change.  Musk, the Pope and Obama all play such important roles in today's society, and it is important for us to know what they think about climate change and how they approach it.  It allows us to see where they are coming from, see what we can learn from them, and also criticize their actions if we believe they are not taking drastic enough measures to help save our planet.
<br><hr>

I agree that the film did a great job of connecting the audience to the real world issues of climate change that are occurring today. I believe that everybody that has watched this film has connected to at least one issue occurring today. Personally, I connected with the segment about the palm oil and meat industries because this is something that I know I can actively change in my diet. I also believe that DiCaprio was a good protagonist in the film and embodies a true environmental activist. 
 <br><br>

The fact is that politicians are too afraid to make the jump to carbon tax and have a fossil-free industry because of the responses of the public. Media has morphed what climate change is and why it is not a valid political issue. The point of the documentary was to educate people with scientific evidence that climate change is real and should not be discussed lightly. Politicians have very much pushed climate change aside and focused on other political issues such as an economy because that is what the media portrays as the most important in our country. However, there is no way of fixing these problems if the planet is dead. People need to come to the realization that climate change is the most important problem of our time and need to take aggressive actions in order to decrease the severity that fossil fuels have had on our environment. I agree that this film was a good introduction to climate change and proves to a lot of people that we have to change now before it is too late.
<br><hr>
I agree that DiCaprio was and is an amazing voice to spread awareness of climate change, similarly to Al Gore. He is able to use his fame for impact. Although it scares me that so many scientists and environmentalists can state the facts of the problem and no one seems to listen.Big news networks like you stated(FOX) claim to "not believe in climate change" and that just simply won't cut it when the effects of climate change are closer than we all think. I also agree with what Leo was saying in the documentary (Before The Flood) about how the more he learns about the issue, the more he realizes he doesn't know about it. This is another example of how media like news, documentaries, and propaganda can spread so much awareness but also so much ignorance. It brings about a realization on other issues like gun control and how so much of politics, which is supposed to bring justice to the people, ends up being controlled by lobbyists like the NRA or oil companies in the case of climate change. If more people like Leo, Musk, and the Pope can not be too scared of change than we will be way more likely to find solutions or slow climate change.
<br><hr>
I find it completely insane that there are so many people who deny the facts and send out false messages to the masses in order to fatten their pockets and in the process dooming us all. Most pf the political figures would bash dicaprio and call climate change a hoax even though there is hard soil evidence. This just goes to show how selfish humans are even when faced with certain doom we still choose our own agenda than the greater good. It was very sad to see how the climate has gotten so bad so fast. It really is eye opening and inspired me to do my part in combatting climate change.
<br><hr>
I agree that DiCaprio was a good ambassador and the world is always in need of someone like him to stand out and actually do something. I took GEOG 3 last quarter and learned the more detailed process of how the Earth is gradually getting polluted and uninhabitable. China as the top 1 polluter did not surprise me since I experienced devastating air pollution these years. The government was afraid of facing the problem and managed to provide the public disinformation on the index of PM 2.5, although the pollution even appeared to be visible. As you said, the portion of people who really act is very small. Let alone some of the governments in the world don’t want to take action. We, as residents on the Earth, are not superior to anything, including nature, which fosters us. I agree with you that none of the people should avoid the truth and the upcoming danger. And there is a long way to go.
<br><hr>
I agree that this film having DiCaprio as the main guy was very effective. The guy is credible and influential, and he is also passionate about climate change and means it. He doesn't just do this for money or fame; he does it because he actually cares about climate change and wants to do something about it, hence his position and respect in the UN. DiCaprio was the perfect vessel for this film as it gives a wide audience a simple yet effective look at the terrors that are occurring around the world right now. The visuals are absolutely stunning as one can see the magnitude of the damage to our environment and how it really is, looking at oil drilling sites and the poor air quality of China. The use of various high-profile figures across different borders of the world not only gave us an engaging film but also an influential one. These were important figures making a point about the world changing and their perspectives about it. Overall, Before the Flood was an excellent film that showcased all the important points and dangers of the earth's changing climate.
<br><hr>
I agree that the influence of figures in pop culture is extremely important in the climate crisis issue. Using a celebrity such as Dicaprio is a smart way of getting the general public involved, Dicaprio admits to not having much knowledge about the climate crisis, but is willing to do anything to bring awareness and help, which I think is the case for many of us. It is overwhelming to hear about the extensive and severe issues surrounding climate change. We’re often faced with questions of what we can do to help, or which of our efforts will actually be substantial enough to make a real difference. 
 <br><br>

I think the most surprising part of the film to me was DiCaprio’s visit to Greenland, in which he observes how much it’s glaciers have melted just in the last decade. I was quite shocked after Dicaprio extends the now exposed 20 foot rope that used to be covered by the glacier. Furthermore, I like that Dicaprio visits several places to address the common issue of sea level rise, because it makes us realize that this issue can and will affect any of us. My only criticism of the film is also that it is not as in depth or alarming enough as an issue line this should be. However, considering it follows DiCaprio’s journey into investigating the climate crisis, I think it is a good starter for those who are not well informed on the topic.
<br><hr>
 I completely agree with people often being more interested in "thoughts and prayers" rather than really trying to make a change. Although I am not vegan, after watching this movie I am going to put in effort to completely cut out animal products from my diet. I have been wanting to be successful in this for years, and now being fueled by all this new information from this film will help me to achieve this goal. I thought this film did an amazing job at showing how different parts of the world will be affected and how they already are being affected by the climate crisis. Especially palm oil which I hadn’t been aware of until watching this film. In addition, I was very surprised that Obama hadn’t done anything about the carbon tax, as this sounds promising and I’m curious if our world would be in a slightly different place if Obama had done things differently. I also thought it was important that the film brought to light the capitalist economy and the politicians who are basically supporting the death of our planet. DiCaprio says “We can not afford to have political leaders out there that do not believe in modern science or the scientific method or empirical truths...we cannot afford to waste time having people in power that choose to believe in the 2 percent of the scientific community that is basically bought off by lobbyists and oil companies”. I love that DiCaprio highlights the words “empirical truths”. We cannot make up or deny numbers. There is no way to look at what is happening to our world from any different angle. I think it is insanely important to have influential people like DiCaprio serve as a climate ambassador because people will naturally want to listen and feel more inclined to act. If more influential people and celebrities gain knowledge on the climate crisis and promote change, this would be another step in a better direction.
<br><hr>
I agree DiCaprio was the right ambassador for this project. Not only is he really passionate with this topic, he is also very influential due to his massive following and can spread the movement much quicker. 
 <br><br>

I resonated with what the woman from India had to say about us Americans. She was essentially calling us out in saying that if we want India to work on their carbon footprint we should reduce our own. Aside from India, China being the number 1 exporter of products to the entire planet and the pollution having to begun affecting them is the consumers fault. Where there is demand, supplies are required. With the massive consumption we require and the consumption based economy and mindset America in particular have, I blame first world countries following America’s footsteps for a massive carbon footprint. The supply responds to the consumer by mass producing The palm oil industry alone has a heavy carbon footprint. Or even the beef industry. These mass produced products on a global scale leave an enormous carbon footprint. Regardless it saddens me to know the islands in the Pacific Ocean are most vulnerable, the communities who contribute the least to climate change will suffer the worst consequences from it.
<br><hr>
While Leonardo DiCaprio seems sincere in his thirst for answers regarding the climate crisis, I disagree with the idea that Leonardo DiCaprio makes a good ambassador for the cause of climate change. During the fall quarter, he flew from his home in Los Angeles to the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport to attend a local film festival via private jet, after which he flew back home. I do not believe that a person who is either unaware of the effects flying has on the environment, or simply choses to ignore them is fit for this title. I hold this belief not because he is wealthy, nor because I expect him to travel the world in a similar fashion to Greta Thunberg, but because a person who choses to fly such a short distance instead of driving a meager two hours is too selfish to hold such a position.
 <br><br>

I do agree with you on almost everything else however. The wastefulness of the beef industry and the overall damage we cause to the planet to sustain our diet is astonishing. "Before the Flood" inspired me to restrict the amount of beef I consume, as well as cutting Nutella out of my diet completely (however difficult it may be). This film, along with "The Uninhabitable Earth" has given me the knowledge I need to not only educate myself but those who are willing to listen.
<br><hr>
I honestly was surprised to see Leonardo DiCaprio in the beginning of the film (Before the Flood) because I did not know much about him outside of his acting career. As I watched more of the film and read your comment, however, I realized that it made sense that he is the main protagonist of this film. I sincerely appreciate his dedication to the environment. Before reading your comment, I did not know that he is a vegan and it comforts me to know that he practice what he preaches in addition to the fact that he is using his fame to spread awareness about such a controversial topic as climate change. Throughout the film, I learned the impact that people’s food choices can affect the environment, especially those that contain palm oil and beef. I am appalled by the negative impact that Nutella and beef can cause and will become more self-aware of my food consumption from now on.
 <br><br>

I also agree that it is a problem that many people do not want to acknowledge the fact that climate change is an issue despite the numerous evidence that support it. It is easier to live in ignorance and continue one’s lifestyle. However, without any changes, all of the frightening consequences that are predicted to occur within this century will become reality. By that time, it will be much too late for any changes. Therefore, the change must happen now because if it does not happen now, it will never happen.

Before the Flood and An Inconvenient Sequel. 
 <br><br>
I agree with Zachary’s opinion that a lot of people say that they care about the climate change problem but they did not take any actions to prevent climate change. It is true that in the previous year, owing to the lack of regulations, China has much more pollutions than other countries. But recently, the Chinese government has realized the importance of continuity of the resource. And the government asks people to protect the environment and prevent the waste of resources.  The file “Before the Flood” encourages people to take action right now to protect our environment since it is not too late. I really admire that Leonardo DiCaprio has been vegan for serval years. He is not building an image that he “cares” about the climate changes but he really takes action to prevent climate changes. 
 <br><br>
It is true that considering climate change will decrease the speeding product of the country. But it helps our planet to reproduce the resources.

1) Was the film effective at communicating it subject? If so, how did it achieve this?
 <br><br>
Yes, the film does effectively communicates its subject by using the personal views and explorations from the famous celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio through the whole film in order to effectively attract more people’s attention and influence more people. Moreover, the celebrity Leonardo tells the audiences his own personal experience about the nature and why he wants to protect it, which successfully make himself closer to the audiences and the audiences can listen to him willingly. Additionally, the film tries to warn people what we can do before the consequences cannot be saved by explaining how we are destroying the planet, such as different kinds of fossil fuels, and how we are trying to save it or ignore it, making people understand more the reasons behind.

 <br><br>
2) Who do you think might be the film’s audience? People already concerned about the issue or casual viewers?
 <br><br>
The audiences of this films are casual viewer especially can be fans of Leonardo. The purpose of letting a celebrity to speak up for a thing is to effect more people and to broaden the popularity range. So through the film, the director wants to reveal more things to a wide range of people in order to pass them the concept that the environment needs to be protected. Moreover, the data given in the film, such as how much ice is melting is basic but still visualizes by the film so that people can understand and sense the need to protect the environment.
 <br><br>

3) What was your general reaction to the film? Was your response primarily intellectual or emotional? In other words, how did the film make you feel? What did it cause you to think about?
 <br><br>
I generally agree the view presented in the film- we need to change the way we are treating the environment and accept the truth that it is getting worse indeed. We cannot convert it but however we can change the situation in time probably by new technologies. Meanwhile the nature has its own power to recover, so there is no need to act panic or rush.  We should intellectually stay optimistic.
 <br><br>

4) Did you learn anything new from the film? If so, what? Did the film change your attitudes in anyway? If so, how? After watching it, did you feel optimistic or pessimistic?
 <br><br>
From my perspective, i feel like people should be more politically involved to protect the environment instead of getting too political, especially the story told by the major of Florida makes me feel shocked.

This film shows the severe climate change as crisis. In this film, Leonardo DiCaprio, as a United Nations Messenger of Peace, traveling to five continents and the Arctic to witness climate change firsthand. As he is a well-known public figure and have great popularity, he can probably make  a great influence on the society and arose people’s awareness of how severe the climate problem is now. Leonardo DiCaprio isn’t know deeply about the climate change. So when he was learning about the environmental issue in his journey, how he react were just similar to how we react when we getting to know those severe issues when we watch the film. This make people feel like they were participating his journey. This film also shows scenes of different places that are somewhat destructed by climate change to give the audience intuitive feeling.
 <br><br>


I felt worry and sad when i saw the image of destructed place shown in the film. Like the image of Arctic area and narwhals swimming in the sea , and the experts said there will be no ice left in the summer in the Arctic Ocean because of the  burning fossil fuel caused by human activities and the ice are melting. Also, the amount of narwhales are declining. This will be such a tragedy. In addition, there’s a scene of foggy weather in Beijing,  people wearing masks walking on the street, school suspended because of the terrible air condition… I fully know how it feel is living in such a air polluted places since i always read the news of many problems in Beijing due to the bad air condition and i have been to Beijing and experience the air there for several times. However, i feel optimistic after watching the movie. Because most of the polluted places are taking action and the government and people there are continuing try their best and seeking for more useful actions to fight the climate change crisis. Although i still have some worry because the pessimistic current situation, i believe it will getting better under people’s effort.



</p><hr>


<p>
I though the movie gave a pretty good journey that people might have needed in order to get through this whole climate crisis journey. I thought that it was nice that he started a foundation too. He was trying to do a lot of exposing different things. DiCaprio sets out to learn more with the viewer.



</p><hr>


<p>
First of all, props to Leonardo DiCaprio. He has been my favorite actor even though I never knew that he is an activist in climate change. Now there is even more reason to love Leonardo. Anyway, climate crisis. In my opinion, it is helpless and devastating after watching NAT GEO's documentary "Before the Flood". I and most of our class, I believe, has been raised in a way in which we are largely benefited by fossil fuel. Even if all U.S. politicians agreed and admitted that climate crisis is a thing that need to be addressed on and prioritized, our generation and others who have built reliance on fossil fuel will not easily let go all the great things fossil fuel provided us despite it is killing the planet we're living on. 
 <br><br>


As an international student, I probably should not criticize U.S. policies and politicians. However, just as Sunita Narain from the Center for Science and Environment said, if U.S. can make the switch [to clean energies] in spite of all the pressure, other countries will also follow. As the most emitted country in history, U.S. has the responsibility to change their reliance on fossil fuel and use their character "World Leader" to make a model and guide the rest of the world to transform their energy industry. But U.S. is not doing and under the regime of current President, I do not see U.S. committing to make a change in near future as well. If U.S. is not leading, who else? China is still a developing country that is no match no U.S. yet they put clean energy at their priority list. My U.S. classmates, you should take what we have learned from this class and make changes starting from our generation so that all livings will be able to expect a bright future.

<p>
After watching the film Before the Flood, I feel sad about the disasters happening in the world. The climate change affects different countries in different. I'm wondering why there are still so many people try to deny the climate change after experiencing drought, flood, and wildfire. Then I realize that they just don't want to admit the climate change because people are afraid of it. They will lose their chance to make more profits, once they admit the existence of the climate change. For example, it is necessary to use the fossil fuel in our daily life, which also makes money for some companies. If they admit the climate change, people have to use less fossil fuel, which is the nightmare for companies and government.



</p><hr>


<p>
Leonardo DiCaprio is a perfect person for an ambassador for the climate. He has such a high position in terms of fame; he's well-known around the world, which allows him to project the ideas and promote activism towards changing climate crisis better than any random politician. Furthermore, we can see a little bit of ourselves in him. Although he's an A-list celebrity, he's still a normal person just like the rest of us. This is shown when he publicly stated when he was appointed ambassador stating how he "might not be the best person for the position" because he still isn't fully knowledgeable in the area. This desire to learn more about the climate crisis is something that we could also do, not just some very famous actor.
 <br><br>


"Before the Flood" does a very good job in expressing its ideas to the point where almost about anyone can understand it. Although the disasters are heavily "abridged", they include the necessary details for people to know the issue. This is how they kept me captivated towards the film.



</p><hr>


<p>
It's not something to do with the truth; it's something to do with the human. The earth itself does not carry opinions. What will happen in the future is pretty much depending on those developed countries. They get to decide how society will go in next couple of decades. If they do not take action and are not willing to cooperate with undeveloped countries, things will never get resolved because the single day emission of pollution in America and China is equal to some African countries' pollution emission in one year. The truth of how we get here is not important until all countries decide to work together to solve it.



</p><hr>


<p>
After watching the documentary “Before the Flood”, I think this documentary give me a new point of view and perspective to rethink about the global warming and climate change. The Unhabitable Earth provides a catastrophic effect of the climate crisis, giving us a panic felling. In this film, we know it is not late to make action to solve this problem.
 <br><br>
This film gives me so many different emotions, which are related to bad stuff like frustration, but the most part is hope. When Leonardo went to China to see hot is  the real bad pollution. When China is the worst polluter in this word, it is amazing to see lots of people live in the horrible conditions because of what we done to the climate crisis.
 <br><br>
Finally, this movie is very helpful for us to understand the effect of climate change, being a leader.




</p><hr>


<p>
Watching Before the Flood, I was struck most by how everything was shown. As someone who followed climate change pretty closely, I knew a lot of the facts already. For example, I knew about the Paris Climate Agreement, about the Scandinavian countries' attempts and successes with emission reduction and elimination, and about the companies and industries responsible.
 <br><br>
As it's aimed for the general public of first-world countries, it does give a general overview of the facts, but the parts that have the most impact are the testimonials and the imagery. The presentation highlights how the climate crisis is something that should elicit an emotional response. The image of The Paradise of Earthly Delights and the rather fitting way it's connected to the title was chilling. The documentary also emphasizes the unfairness of climate change. The places that have contributed the least will be hurt the most, while the U.S. and other major emitters tell them to lower their emissions. The hopefulness of the scientists contrast against their own words describing the looming specter of climate change and make it feel a little less hopeless and makes me feel a little more motivated. The ending makes the purpose of Before the Flood clear: it's primarily a call to action.
 <br><br>
Nonetheless, the tactic of using DiCaprio as a surrogate for the viewer/protagonist does have its limitations: while this is a good introductory documentary, it leans a bit on rhetorical devices meant to inspire emotional responses, which may put some off
 <br><br>
.  Plus, as an upper-class and high-profile person himself, DiCaprio may have a bigger footprint than the average American.
 <br><br>
I did like that the filmmakers offset their footprint with a carbon tax voluntarily. I would rate this film 8/10, and I would definitely recommend it, as it is good at communicating the basics and impacts of climate change.



</p><hr>


<p>
When watching the film Before the flood, I was a bit surprised to see that Leonardo DiCaprio had been given the prize United Nations Messanger of Peace as even though that he was an activist for climate change, he was still greatly uneducated in the situation. However, I do completely acknowledge and appreciate his efforts towards making an effort to make people more aware of the climate crisis. It was really interesting to be learning alongside DiCaprio, however, this only made me question, even more, the UN's decision. I believed that this video would be a great introduction video to the climate crisis to people who just started to believe in it, or are really uneducated in the subject. It explained the basic information. overall it was a great video that exposed a bunch of information such as the Koch brothers, the impact that the US has done compared to other countries, and the rate that other countries are trying to change their ways of economy and structure in their city.

<p>
I completely agree, Before the Flood takes the audience on a trip with Leonardo DiCaprio’s persona whose intimate interviews reveal the reality of what’s going on with our global climate. From deforestation, oil excavation, and calving, there are so many ways in which humanity’s anthropogenic activities have punctured a hole in our future. I had heard little of Leonardo DiCaprio’s activism prior to the movie as well and seeing the lengths that he has gone to even become a UN messenger of peace made me so much more invested. DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors and I can distinctly recall a quote from the movie Inception which could apply to the political nature of his mission, “an idea is like a virus, resilient, highly contagious. The smallest seed of an idea can grow.” I believe that taking political action is our greatest chance at making a difference, and only through the words of those with political power can that dream be fulfilled. Reducing carbon emissions and pollution can no longer just be ideas at this point, but ideas that have been turned into action and enforced around the world. It breaks me to see the influence that politics has over this. With a country run by fossil fuel funded politicians, it’s hard to envision a life where money doesn’t play a huge factor in how important decisions are made. If other countries can adapt to renewable resources, then the United States can too. I hope DiCaprio continues to act as a role model not only for his fans and admirers, but his peer celebrities who have a greater presence in the media.

<p>
"Before the Flood" is such an interesting film to me because it pairs one of the world's most well-known and celebrated actors, Leonardo DiCaprio, and pairs him with one of the least understood and mostly not-valued problem of climate change. It's an interesting dynamic because it makes you wonder what type of audience the film will draw in and the impact it might have. Will people ridicule DiCaprio and call him an uneducated sham who does not know what he is talking about? Or will people praise him simply because he is a well-known actor and follow him blindly? Either way, Leonardo DeCaprio does an amazing job at communicating the film’s message that climate change is having devastating effects on the world around us that we are oblivious to. Putting a visual aid to present the terrible consequences really humanizes the situation and puts it into a perspective that is easy to grasp.
  <br><br>
A big name actor creating a film about climate change is uncommon, so the film was most likely intended to re-shape people’s feelings about it.

 <br><br>


Watching the movie was really surprising for me and really saddening as I watched what as humans we have done to the world. Seeing fossil fuel companies contribute to a majority of the problem and deny climate change was infuriating and made me reconsider which companies I choose to support in my daily life.The film brought to life the reality of climate change and how its constant controversy in American society is problematic. Although I was aware of the negative side effects of fossil fuels due to lectures in class, the film really solidified my knowledge in the area in a visual way.

I agree with the idea that combining Leonardo DiCaprio, a very popular and appraised actor in America, with a repressed environmental crisis message was very effective in grasping more attention from the public eye and convincing more people of its severity and urgency. Although some see DiCaprio as a poser or uneducated on the topic due to his career in the film industry, he is in fact someone who has conducted a side career as an environmental activist, and in fact has been using his platform of fame and respect to the benefit of the entire population and planet. It is not common for a famous actor to be spending his extra time and money on producing a documentary to spread awareness about a global issue, and so i think this film was especially successful in portraying that climate change and a reduced carbon footprint on a personal, day-to-day, level is something that even the richest and most privileged members of our society must consider. 
<br><br>
 I also agree with this student’s view on how DiCaprio was very successful in presenting the facts about climate change in a way which seemed more comprehensive and not so terrifying and overwhelming. This may have been due to the way he uses visual aids in the explanation of the effects of the concentration of carbon dioxide in our air that we are currently on track to hit, as it will start to effect highly industrialized cities such as NYC, which Americans would probably do anything to preserve. However, we would willingly let our ice caps melt because directly, this has no effect on our access to Starbucks every morning, or our ability to buy a new car every other year. Therefore, this movie brings transparency to how, soon, our lives will no longer look the same and that even a slight awareness of how much carbon emissions we are producing on a daily basis can spur a revolution to a new American lifestyle of sustainable life free from fossil fuel burning.

In the film “the Inconvenient Sequel”, Ai Gore is the pioneer about climate change. He traveled different countries to train people with the information about climate crisis. Nowadays, huger information about climate change exists for a long time. Many people do not know how to deal with climate change or what happen with the climate change. Training around the world is a good way to introduce the real results of the climate change. A point making me impressive is the explosion of the iceberg. I really like the natural landscape of these icebergs. But, now it is melting. And the speed of melting is increasing. The water of melting icebergs went to different cities closing to the sea. For example, the sea level of Miami, Florida have increased a lot. As a result, water spread on the road. Also some cities’ conditions are more severe. Flooding caused by climate change create lots of refugees. And many people died because of flooding. That is make me very sad. But the documentary also give us some positive expectation. India needs some conventional resource including coals and fossil fuels, because their price is cheaper than renewable energy. Some developed countries do not want to give financial support to India. Thus, India are encountering a dilemma. However, with the efforts of Gore, a agreement achieved among different countries and solved the dilemma. Because 65% carbon pollution is from developing countries, if more and more countries can do the same thing, we will have a better relationship with the nature. I will recommend my friends to watch this movie. The training of Gore should alert more and more people.

I think that the film Before the Flood did a really good job introducing the topic of the climate crisis to the world.  The way that the film contrasted beautiful footage of many different parts of the world with the destruction/negative effects that climate change is having, like the ice melting in Greenland or the decay and death of coral reefs, was very impactful and did a very good job of showing what is going on all around the world.  One of the parts that was the most alarming to me was how much misinformation is going around in the world, and how lobbyist groups and politicians spread these lies as they are just after profit.  I think that if we want to see a  change in the world, we the people are going to have to do it ourselves and take matters into our own hands, as it has been made evident that we will be getting no help from a higher authority.  I think that a lot of politicians and other higher-ups follow and voice the opinions of where money flows, but if enough people voice their opinions and gain public traction, it can have the power to do some real change; whether that be shifting the actions of politicians or gaining more traction in the world. The film gave me a lot of hope by showing how many people are aware of this issue and the things that they are trying to bring even more awareness and come up with solutions.  One of these things was Elon Musk's "gigafactory."   The world is technologically advancing very rapidly, and I think this is just the start of many more radical solutions that the world will come up with for the future.
<br><br>


Although DiCaprio had a very pessimistic attitude on the issue, I think that more people are becoming aware of just how severe climate change is getting, and how corrupted our country's politicians are, which gives me hope that we the people can encourage a positive change.  Seeing how there are already many countries starting to implement more environmentally friendly ways of life, like Sweden ditching fossil fuels, gives me hope for a brighter future.

For the film of "Before the Flood," the use of fossil energy is a subtle reflection of the imbalance of economic development. Each American consumes an average of 22 Indians. After all, it is the imbalance of economic development, the dilemma of whether developing countries like China and India use fossil energy, and the contradiction between the pursuit of a better life and limited resources. This choice is very realistic. Most people will choose the latter between destroying the environment and ensuring survival.
<br><br>

Gregory Mankiw’s interview in the movie is fascinating. He said that a carbon tax is a better way to live a low-carbon life than a moral appeal. People certainly know the importance of environmental protection, but when turning the key to turn on the car engine, few people will think of the carbon emission. Shortsightedness, the nature of humankind,  is impossible to change. Only when the damage is embodied in every detail of life can it remind people of their grand mission to save the planet. Moreover, when the idea is prevalent,  people's decisions will further influence the attitude of politicians.
<br><br>

For greenhouse gases, it is still a prisoner's dilemma. When most people are on the path of high energy consumption, people who choose low-carbon life will suffer. When most people choose to live with low energy consumption, but some people live with high energy consumption, their sacrifice of self-interest becomes the welfare of others. The final equilibrium is that all parties choose a high energy consumption lifestyle in order not to suffer losses.
<br><br>

The saddest thing is that the island countries that have been submerged in the Pacific Ocean have the least harm to the environment, but received the most significant harm. The unlimited carbon emissions of human beings are like killing weapons. The most outraged thing is that palm oil companies in Indonesia burn forests to grow palm trees. Such a company has no sense of responsibility to the earth and human beings. Most admired person is Elon Musk, who said that if there are 100 super solar plants, they can provide all the energy in the world. From his eyes, you can see the future. The most gratifying thing is that human beings are in action. Sweden and Denmark will become countries that do not use fossil energy. Furthermore, I also believe that with the development of science, more and more countries will reduce or even stop carbon emissions.
<br><br>

Whether it is recognized or not, the environment and climate change are happening, and they interact and strengthen. We really should act, because this is our shared responsibility.

Just like A Climate of Doubt, this film gives us a broad vision of how the public is deluded by misinformation about climate change. But in this film, if focuses more on the viable solutions to solve the problem of human-caused climate change all around the world, especially in the US. 
<br><br>

At the beginning of the film, led by Leonardo DiCaprio, it has showed us how the climate has been changing in the recent decade. Then it focuses on the melting ice sheets in the North Poles and the air pollution in India and China. I was actually not shocked because I'm a Chinese and I know about the condition of the air pollution in China. And the greenhouse gases produced by deforestation, mining, agriculture and burning fossil fuels are destroying the earth's environment and ecology. But the thing is, nowadays, half of the officers and senators in the US government refused to keep working on dealing with climate change, even the current president. And there are people, especially those from coal industry, working hard on proving that the climate change does not even exist, just for their continuing benefits. 
<br><br>

The climate crisis is no longer an environmental issue right now, but a political issue since if the government doesn't do the right thing, many people will still be misguided and don't know what to do. What's more, now we' have already passed the time when small things like changing the light bulbs made by individuals are enough. I think the government really need to consider the climate change seriously and do something, not by keep denying and neglecting it.

The cinema  “An Inconvenient Sequel” was a clever and insightful visual piece. I initially decided to watch and explore this particular film because I had already watched "Before the Flood"  prior in English 22 but  it ended up being quite elaborate and detailed. The film did a great job, it  demonstrated both the  present issues & possible solutions regarding the volatile nature/ process of the climate change crisis. 
<br><br>
For example,  Al Gore was genuinely detailed and showed the outmost care for our natural world. Al Gore's testimony was contagious & both invigorated my desire to go out there and recycle e-waste, help my"cool-block" group more extensively but also made me more proactively wary of the environmental issues that we feed into without thinking in our everyday lives. It was a rollercoaster of emotions to say the least. 
<br><br>

It is inspirational to see that there are communities & even whole nation worldwide who are committed to enacting change to save our planet i.e. the climate conference. However, our nation the U.S. as sad it may be has pulled out and caused a big stir in the commitment of the international community to saving our planet. I am definitely not fond of the 45th President of the U.S.. Still let us not focus on one person of the root of the trouble but at all the structural systems and dynamics of power that enabled such a foe to the health of our Planet into the White House.
<br><br>

Such a foe to the health of our Planet is not only worsening the conditions of the most vulnerable of humans and nations, but also that  of our Plants an animal brethren. Masses of species are going extinct every day, year. And  many other animals will have to migrate in order to survive, if they do not they will perish. Still, Al Gore,  explains that there are things that us humans have successfully developed in order to protect our biodiversity &  the environment i.e renewable energy & more env. friendly technology. This is invigorating  for the masses and policymakers who truly are committed to enacting vision changes for our world. All in all I definitely would recommend this film to all my peers and underclassmen, friends, and family.

Before watching “Before the flood”, I found it suspicious of celebrities like DiCaprio to shoot documentaries containing political issues. I don’t trust him until I watched this. 
<br><br>
It all started with The garden of Earthly Delights which depicts three phases of our earth. And currently we are in the second phase of overpopulation. 
<br><br>
The over emission of carbon dioxide which caused the greenhouse gas effect. We are facing an accelerating climate change. However, why we humans are using so much fossil fuels that we know are harmful? Because our economy is built on fossil fuels. They take our forests and water. The ice bergs are decreasing and melting faster. In 2040, by prediction, there will be no sea ice in the Arctic Ocean.
<br><br>
People used to focus on simple personal things like changing their light bulbs to help protecting the world. However, our environment is controlled by different politicians and corporations in ways people don’t notice. They are pressing on medias that there’s no climate change at all. Politicians are funded by fossil fuel companies, so they don’t think there’s fossil fuel problems. 
<br><br>
I was surprised that the documentary picked up China as an example of huge industrialization and protection of the environment. China’s usage of solar power and wind power over coal is shifting the country’s energy sources.
<br><br>
The documentary also raise up the question of what shall less developed and more populated places could do about the environment? India plays a great role in this scene. If a country’s overall population is sinked in poverty, how can they be able to use cleaner energy sources that they can’t afford? Also, why shall these places which caused least to the environment problems bear the most severe outcomes? These problems need to be addressed in a more fair and justice way. 
<br><br>
This documentary also provides great ways that ordinary people can do. Beef is the most ineffective use of source that take 47% of land but produce methane which is more disastrous than carbon dioxide. People can switch to different kinds of meat. That will help the environment a lot, according to the scientists.
<br><br>
The final part of The Paris Summit gives audience hope that there are people from different areas concerning this issue and they are taking actions. But the actions are not enough. Raising audience’s acknowledgements is the only way to influence politicians to do things people want them to do. Only the change from the bottom can change the higher structure of the society. 
<br><br>
This documentary provide me with many vivid and astonishing informations about the climate change and global warming. Everyone should bring a behavior revolution into their lives.

In the film "Before the Flood," I've understood that each asset that each nation, regardless of it being a poor or a rich nation, gives or damages and play a significant part of the reason for environmental change. It's basic that the pioneers of each nation know about what they ought to do. In "Before the Flood," DiCaprio built up a solid contention and powerful issue to persuade surely understood pioneers to uphold possible ecological procedures to the world and face the genuine issue. This quickly made me consider why it has taken us such a long time. Environmental change has been a known issue for quite a long time and it appears as though it has taken up to this point for the issue to be paid attention to. Moreover, I believe that it was significant for the film to address the way that numerous individuals don't think climate change is happening. Overall, i enjoyed watching this movie. This film makes individuals realize that we can't overlook an Earth-wide temperature boost any longer. We need to be aware of these unnatural weather changes, especially for our kids and our kids' kids so they can live peacefully on our beautiful planet earth.

As a climate activist himself, DiCaprio actually goes to the UN as a messenger of peace to present his concerns and the concerns of world citizens about the threats climate change are currently posing. One of the most alarming things I found from this film was how there have been many campaigns and propaganda focused on misinforming the public or confusing the public on climate change in order to create doubt and sway over votes or power. The film does a good job at showing how politics, money, and power play a role in the inaction on climate change and the complicity of governments in the destruction of the earth's natural resources, such as land, air, water, food, and vegetation. It reveals how the fossil fuel industry has bought its way into the U.S government and has continued to fund campaigns, and how the federal government has been making decisions in the best interest of multinationals and their financial profit.  Another interesting point I appreciated from this film was DiCaprio’s meeting with the Pope. Pope Francis is an avid climate change activist and has publicly denounced the destruction of the planet by high levels of greenhouse gases, and other climate injustices. This was a very significant moment because it shows how climate change is a threat that has no boundaries affecting all people on earth, regardless of race, religion, and social standing. Overall, I found this film to be an important film that needs to be shown in more classes and platforms to raise some urgency about the climate crisis.

I remember watching the first few minutes of "Before the Flood"  in English 22 and thinking: what right or credibility does a hollywood pretty boy like Leonardo Dicaprio have to comment and narrate on the issue of the climate crisis?  Upon watching the film, however, I asked myself: what right do I have to judge and disapprove of what Dicaprio is representing as I sit on my bed and do nothing about the looming climate disaster? Despite his seemingly flamboyant reputation, Dicaprio contributes to the cause by putting his fame to use in hopes of reaching a larger audience and informing them the dangerous road this world is heading down if no action is taken against climate change, which I deeply respect.
<br><br>


Unlike "Before the Flood", "An Inconvenient Sequel" focuses on climate change, in addition to the political mechanisms behind the topic of climate change. This was surprisingly an emotional film for me, as I often caught myself sighing in disbelief from time to time and getting teary-eyed when Prime Minister Modi finally agreed to the Paris Agreement after extensive deliberations and ultimatums with Al Gore and other environmentalists. It was a magnificent sight to see the union of humankind to fight against a common enemy-the climate crisis. This film has spectacular objectivity when it comes to the  topic of politics behind climate change. Although I was frustrated with the initial reluctance of Prime Minister Modi on taking actions against climate change, I realized that I was incapable of getting truly angry. Despite India being one of the most impacted countries of climate change, I understand Prime Minister Modi's initial position of reluctance and helplessness. After all, what can a man do to mitigate climate change when much of his citizens live in extreme poverty and don't even have the access to electricity at all? In addition, It was awfully unfair for the U.S. as a developed nation to propose that India should stop utilizing fossil fuels and coal when the U.S. had a 150 year head start in using these materials that contributed to the destructive greenhouse effect and climate change we face today. After Al Gore made a deal to support India in the starting of using solar energy and hence passing the Paris Agreement, I was genuinely moved by the act of nations helping one another in building a bright future. I look forward to Trump's impeachment and hope for all voters and leaders to realize that fighting climate change is not one nation's effort, but the world's effort.

The film "Before the Flood" was surprisingly very good. In todays day and age, it can be hard to get people to listen to a problem unless you are famous or can make a big enough scene. In this instance, Leonardo DiCaprio used his wealth and fame for good. he traveled around the World seeking opinions and answers. Many people became intrigued in what this famous actor was doing. This luckily gave way to many more people actually viewing the film and learning something very new or revisiting an old subject. I have known about climate change but never truly took the time to research and learn for my own. As I was watching this film, I started feeling so many emotions. I love hiking and biking or even simply being in nature. Watching the destruction of Earth and the loss of so much beauty as the oceans and world is covered in trash and eroded away. I was upset, sad, confused, and wasn't sure what to do after that. DiCaprio does a great job of finding public figures that people would be interested in hearing. 
<br><br>
It is frustrating to know that Climate Change has become such  political topic. Why is the destruction of Earth a debatable subject? Why cant we unite and figure it out together instead of greedily trying to make the most profit. It is terrible and I am so blown away that tis is the current state our nation and many other nations are in right now. The United States has blown off Climate Change while other countries try to make a change. This film not only enlightened me, but it gave me new spirit to make change happen.

Before the Flood is an excellent documentary. It deeply reveals the political game, economic entanglement and national differences behind global warming. The combination of Leonardo’s personal experience and the world trend is a stroke of genius. During Leonardo's dialogues with people with lofty ideals all over the world have guided the further deepening of the theme, the film slowly reveals the causes behind global warming and the obstacles that have been difficult to resolve. In the first half of the film, by switching back and forth between exploration of environmental protection in his youth and present time, it highlights his deepening understanding of environmental protection.
<br><br>

After watching the film Before the Flood, I was deeply moved by the environmental action. Toward the end of the film, Leonardo interviews Dr. Mary Pierce Sellers, director of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and a former astronaut. His pancreatic cancer, which has metastasized all over his body, makes the film even more pessimistic. The public is interested by the astonishing intuitive picture. However, public awakening and human behavior are not entirely two sides of the same coin, that is, public awakening and changes in human behavior are not logically inevitable. They are two individual things. Even though it’s a sad news, and I'm very moved by people who participate in environmental protection, since changes in real world are not that easy to make. If they are not viewed through the lens of history, the film is more like a fleeting highlight.

Film: Before the blood 
<br><br>
The film smartly uses Leonardo DiCaprio as a lens to help audience more engaged and feel more interested in the movie throughout the whole journey. It is pretty clever to use a person’s view instead of informative explaining all the time. In the movie, I got a new idea of how beef industry connected with the release of greenhouse gas and methane to the atmosphere. Moreover, I also know that eating chicken helps protecting the earth more than eating beef. Originally, I don’t know how these two concepts would connect with each other; But now, I understand I need to be more careful when I choose meat to cook and eat. With all the horrible data and awful pictures and sounds presented in the film, people will learn and feel how global warming and climate crisis would really affect people’s life. At the beginning, people will not find it as a big business; however, after watching this film, people will be aware of all the actions they do in the earth

this is a film that talks about the actor, Leonardo DiCaprio. He went over the world to find the effect caused by global warming. this is a documentary talked about to save our planet. the planet is our home. Everyone needs to protect this planet. no one can survive if the planet has died. In the documentary, you are going to see a worldwide tour of diverse ecological systems. When you watch the film, you will see how does our consumerism causes this disaster. You are going to see evidence of how do our behaviors cause global warming. And the audience will see how serious effects will be caused by global warming with different evidence. And Leonardo DiCaprio uses his influence to make people pay attention to global warming. I love this film a lot. This film makes people know that we can't ignore global warming anymore. We have to envisage global warming. If we want our children can still live on this beautiful planet, we have to protect it. Please protect our planet!

<p>
I have three points with the climate crisis that is related to everyone during and after the movie "Before the Flood."  
<br><br>
Firstly, I am really convinced that the world is in deeper danger than yesterday, but unfortunately, it is the truth of progressing. I mean you cannot just expect the climate to be better when the industries are pumping out energies. 
<br><br>
Second, people like me are not doing things to help resolve the climate for a reason. We are too multidimensional to really put ourselves in Earth's shoes. Like me, six courses a week, nearly 2/3 of the week are classes, and the remaining time is for homework. There is absolutely no time to get to know about climate change, let alone made some sacrifices. Also, there is no specific and obvious aim and way for our normal people to help the climate. I noticed that there is a solution mentioned in the movie ----- do not eat beef. Really? Imagine putting all my work and effort into my college lives and I have to say no to my favorite beef at Portola? That is a No-No. The government also did not suggest any useful means to help to conserve the planet. I at least myself right now do not have a clear clue about the climate crisis.
<br><br>
Last but not least, the American Political structure, which mostly exists in many other countries, restricted the spread of saving the Earth. The Capitalistic Market cares about the dollars in their pockets, not other people's lives. They can fly anywhere safe so they do not need to do anything except stopping any strikes would happen in their factories. The one thing that is good about China is that although it is the highest pollution emitting country now, the Chinese government knows about what is right. They will put policies on all the factories that are not environmental-qualified, and factories must obey, or they will be shutting down. China is not as a country like America that money can speak much louder. China will be the fastest environmental-friendly developing country and will also be the best one.

This film was produced by Leonardo DiCaprio who started off by giving a speech about global warming. He was able to visit many different sites such as the production of tar sands, and melting glaciers in Greenland, and even the inside of the UN. He talked about how most of our economy is based on fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Oil allows us to have transportation and coal and natural gas allows us to have electricity. He even gave many interviews to talk about the negative effects that are going on with people like Elon Musk, John Kerry, and the president of Kiribati. Adding scenes like this makes his argument very compelling and allows the audience to trust in his words. As he goes around the world, DiCaprio is showing how climate change has a large effect on the whole world. For example, he shows the glaciers and polar ice caps melting in Greenland and explains how the ice used to be much thinker until climate change had its effects on it. He explains that by the year 2040 you will actually be able to sail over the north pole which makes the audience have a visual of what climate change is doing to our world to hopefully make them see how much of a problem this really is. With all this ice melting, it is also adding water to the ocean where it will then flood over our cities. Regardless, instead of changing their ways to help reduce global warming, people are putting their money to raise roads and add pumps that are only going to help for up to 50 years. 
<br><br>
I think this film had a lot of points and given that Leonardo DiCaprio actual took the time to visit these sites himself just to show the audience what is going on gives him a lot of credibility. At the beginning of the documentary it showed people going against him being a speaker against climate change because he was just an actor putting on a good face for the public, but I think he really proved himself. I think I would recommend this film to a friend because it showed some reliable sources and interviews that really give the audience the opportunity to see this themselves.

Before watching "Before the Flood", I only knew the concept of the climate crisis. But after watching it, all concepts became vivid in my mind, and I can even imagine myself in each kind of climate situation. By using Leonardo as the main character, the director can draw people's attention to this film since he is quite famous around the world. Only by letting people watching the film, they can understand what climate crisis is and what will happen if we don't cope with it.

<p>
What I found most interesting about Before the Flood, is Leonardo DiCaprio. I'm almost grateful that he's using his platform to bring attention to the climate crisis. He's such a strong environmentalist. The film is interesting and entertaining to watch because he takes the viewers on a journey to discover how pressing the climate crisis is. It demonstrates how climate change is already happening, where, and how it affects the people living in those areas. 
<br><br>


As for the inconvenient sequel, it was not as compelling as Before the Flood but very shocking. It shed a light on the corruptness of our government and the power that industries and companies have on our political system. Al Gore's satellite that would monitor the climate and take images of the earth was completely reinvented so it had none of the climate capabilities and only worked to serve the corporations that run our government. It seemed to reflect what's happening in politics today. Whenever environmentalists attempt to progress forward, corporations will defer that progress for their own gain at the expense of the environment. Miamis mayor, a climate denier, is being affected by the problem but still continues to deny it. It is not a result of ignorance, it is a result of special interests. Corporations working to dismantle environmental progress for the degradation of the environment. The utility companies for example have a monopoly on solar panels. Florida has made it so you can only get solar panels from fossil fuel companies. The exposure on corruption is what makes this film shocking, however it is not as compelling at DiCaprio's film. Before the Flood demonstrates the diverse affect of climate change, whereas gore focuses on climate change and corruption in the United States. Both of these films are incredible and do an excellent job at highlighting the climate crisis and its present effects.

In “Before the Flood,” I felt uncomfortable realizing that in politics, climate change is treated like a game and not addressed as a global issue. Climate change in no way should be politicized because at some point, if not seen right now, it will affect every single person living on this earth; it does not pick and choose if one decides to ignore the crisis. It is sickening to know that politicians would intentionally deceive the public because lobbyists pay them money to allow big oil companies to continue “business as usual.” 
<br><br>
I enjoy this documentary because it takes a moderate approach to climate change. DiCaprio did a good job with this because it allows skeptics to see an overview of climate change; not an alarmist approach, and also not too modest. I think this way it is able to be more impactful for a large audience.

Leonardo DiCaprio visits multiple places around the world that have been affected by world
climate change. I find it interesting that they chose to name Leonardo DiCaprio as the United
Nations Messenger of Peace. At first, I thought that it may have been a publicity stunt due to his
popular status as a celebrity. I thought to myself that they probably could have chosen someone
who was more qualified (education wise/knowledge in the industry) to be the United National
Messenger of Peace. But after watching DiCaprio reflect on his privilege and gain a larger
understanding of the climate change issues going on the world, I think that having him as an
ambassador was the right choice. Many people are oblivious to what's happening to the world so
it's the right choice to include a voice that many people are willing to listen to. Leonardo
DiCaprio has been in the public spotlight for so long, and loved by so many people, so his own
awakening to climate change will inspire others to follow in his footsteps. The film did a good
job introducing climate change because the audience is similar to DiCaprio-- everyday people
who may not be as environmentally aware. As he becomes more aware, the audience also has
that same social awakening. The most shocking part of the film was when Dicaprio visited the
burnt palm forests. I knew that palm oil was a problem but not to this extent, it was very
saddening to see how these forests are being torn down. It also surprised me that the companies
leave the locals to clean the toxic chemicals by themselves. It angers me that these companies
take advantage of our environment and are unwilling to hold themselves accountable.

<p>
I like that “An Inconvenient Sequel” discussed how India was not entirely convinced to switch to renewable energy because they barely had access to energy from coal and oil. I think that people forget that less developed countries do not have access to the same resources that we do in the United States. The film touched on how more developed countries were putting the blame of climate change onto third world countries. India rightfully called the United States hypocrites because we have had the resources to cut back on carbon emissions for so long and only recently acted on it. 
<br><br>
I learned that the Paris Agreement was built off of a 24 hour live stream that had to be suspended due to a terrorist attack. I did not know how the conference was called or why other than that there was a large group of people from different countries that wanted to slow or stop climate change. I thought it was effective showing interviews of Donald Trump from when he was still campaigning, saying that he thought climate change was very low on the list of problems and that he planned on pulling the US out of the Paris Agreement if he became president. Even with the obvious effects that climate change, he was still voted for president of one of the largest contributors to CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. This shows Gore’s audience the power that money has over politics, the main reason why the US airstrike on Iraq was ordered just over a week ago for a resource that is harmful to the Earth. 
<br><br>
I think one of the best parts of this film is that he looks back on what he said in his previous film and how it has aged now, such as how he predicted that rising sea levels would flood the 9/11 memorial and how it actually happened due to a storm. This event backed him up and gave him some credibility, which he had problems establishing in the past. It shows that he has done his research and is dedicated to helping with the fight against climate change and deniers.

I viewed the film ‘Before the Flood’ once previously in a geography class in high school. When I watched it for the first time I was struck that a hollywood starlet like DiCaprio was so  involved in climate science and promoting environmental awareness. He acknowledges that he is an unlikely poster boy, questioning if the UN made right decision.  Though the film’s protagonist is a recognizable actor in addition to being am environmental ambassador it introduces actual crises and their environmental impact. It is not government propaganda or a pretty face slapped on a documentary to distract from the issues at hand. The film focuses heavily on the unprecedented danger of climate change deniers and exposes corporate lobbyists America & politicians having ulterior nefarious and selfish motives. It offers positive solutions as well, like introducing a carbon tax to curb massive carbon production and pollution.

In this documentary, Leonard went to the places all over the world in order to think about the true effects that climate change brought to these regions. After traveling to several continents and witness the climate change, he got a thoughtful vision about how climate change was changing the world. The last part of the speech is really touching because of the flashback of various scenery photos. Knowing that palm oil is made by burning rainforests to get land, I do not want to eat it anymore. The climate change is causing the disappearance of ice and ocean islands. To make sure our future generations to see the ice or go to an ocean island for vacation, we should take actions now to stop the climate change. What we can do right now is to realize our life style is damaging to the earth, which means we have to change it. We can do our parts by using less AC, taking more public transportation, and eating vegetables instead of consuming meats. This film introduced the climate crisis successfully, since when I see the The scene displaying the change of the nature, such as the disappearing arctic land and the flood caused by the melting of Ice which destroyed the city and land. And I reflected myself. I never imagine climate change is so serious now because I think I live in a good environment and do not feel any change or discomfort change that climate brought to me. However, the more comfortable we live on this planet, the more we need to know about it. And recently I noticed that the summer is hotter than past years, and the winter is warmer. If I can notice the change of temperature, the nature will feel this change much before me, and it might have been affected by it. So there is a need to save the earth. As a individual, we should do something to change it although the action we make might be trivial. But if millions of people make this trivial action, the effect can be enormous.

Before the flood is a great movie that exposes so much problems. In the movie, Leonardo has traveled to several countries in two years. The trip when Leonardo visited Canadian Arctic is really appealing to me.Before I watched the movie, I just finished watching a show talking about a group went on a journey to north pole. The people in the show has closely exposed the beauty of the Arctic but the fact that the ice sheets and all the beauty is on the way fading. Now here in this documentary movie, the problem was addressed again that ice is melting which is all due to the human activities. People burned too much fossil fuels, leading to the huge amount of carbon dioxide releasing in the atmosphere. 
<br><br>
After watching the whole movie and seeing so many countries around the world under the impact of climate crisis, I actually feel most pitiful to those small islands in the Arctic. The local of those islands has stated that“their nations contribute the least to the causes of climate change, but they are going to feel the worst impacts, the worst scenarios because of global warming.” Due to the global warming, the sea level raises, and those small island in the Arctic would firstly faced the problem like flood. It’s just unfair that they have did least to bring up the climate crisis, but the whole nation would faced the most catastrophic ending. I hope the country like USA and Europe which contributes to most of the CO2 in the atmosphere will make a leading role in taking the actions in transition to prevent the tragedy.

<p>
The film "Before The Flood" sets out to show its audience the impact of climate change and causes that we need to pay attention to. Leonardo Dicaprio acts as an ambassador of the climate crisis and advocates for change while traveling the world and understanding more about climate change. As Dicaprio traveled he interviewed Narain, a woman living in india, who held the US responsible as one of the worlds largest over consumers to take the lead in the climate crisis. This means that we have to hold our government officials responsible for taking action.To save the coastal cities from floods by sea level rise or to keep the water acidity at a level where coral reef could survive we have to change the way we consume and produce. 
<br><br>
This film makes me believe that there is some hope in our government to help with the climate crisis. To really implement change it has to start from above. Restricting things like palm oil for example would be something the government has to do. It would save all these forest from deforestation and would end up helping the climate because it has a healthy carbon converter instead of none at all. Another industry that needs regulation is the beef industry which accounts form most of the methane gas in the atmosphere. We use "50 times as much land as fruits and vegetables for cattle livestock" which contributes more to climate change. This film effectively shows that climate change is not just something to be pushed aside. It is a real issue and change must be demanded and implemented to save the planet for all life.

<p>
Before the floor Movie:
<br><br>
Taking a look at the movie as a whole, there definitely was the sense of a need to change our ways in order to save the planet. However, I thought that it was interesting to see the movie being conducted by Leonardo Dicaprio. I personally found it warming that someone with such privilege and power in an American industry is taking so much time and investing their resources into fighting climate change and raising awareness for it. It just really goes to show that climate change affects us all and that there really is no point in doing anything if our planet will be uninhabitable. More specifically however, there were some points that I found to be especially compelling.
<br><br>


1. The fact that there were many people that do not believe in climate change. Going through the montage of clips showing people reject the possibility of there even being a chance of climate change was alarming because it was at a time that is not too far from now. I was not aware that climate change was not always an accepted fact.
<br><br>
2. I was disgusted by the role that money and investment in fossil fuels played in government action and policies in regard to climate change. You would think that with being faced with such grave danger, the government would respond with methods in which we all could reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted. But the reality is that many government officials completely disregarded the threat because it meant that they would have to lose their investment in the industry. 
<br><br>
3. America has done almost nothing in changing their ways and trying to adopt renewable and cleaner energy. During the interview with the environmental scientist in India, the Dr. brought up good points when she blamed America for a lot of the environmental problems we have today. The fact that America is the largest producer of greenhouse gases, yet has not taken any steps towards renewable energy, it really felt unfair and reminded me a lot of what we talked briefly about in lecture about climate injustice.



</p><hr>


<p>
In the film, “Before the Flood,” Leonardo DeCaprio explores the consequences of climate change across the world. There were several aspects that were particularly thought-provoking for me. One was at the beginning of the film where he discusses the painting by Hieronymus Bosch. He follows this with an audio snippet that says, “Man may be unwittingly changing the climate through the waste products of its civilization.” Similar to the painting that depicts how man’s indulgence and dominion over the natural world eventually led to its destruction, this audio excerpt provokes the question, what does it mean to be civilized? What is our idea of progress, and how has this constructed definition led to us into the climate crisis? 
<br><br>

The fact that this narrative is told by such a famous figure allows the film to resonate with a diverse audience, and one that may not be all that familiar with the climate crisis. I think the film does a great job at taking an issue that seems very abstract and intangible and breaking it down into something that is more easily digestible by the audience. 
<br><br>

I also found it interesting when he began talking about animals that have gone extinct. He talks about it with a sense of wonder, curiosity and nostalgia. It makes me think, what does extinction mean to us? We hear about it a lot, especially as students in environmental studies. Most of us have been to museums or have at least learned about extinct animals in school, yet we don’t truly grasp the fact that these animals no longer exist. What would it mean to accept our role in the extinction rates of animals today? It feels almost as if we are desensitized to the idea of extinction.
<br><br>

Lastly, the connections between powerful vested interests, politics, and the many injustices that surround climate change run as deep as our dependence on fossil fuels. We don’t understand the implications of this because they are somewhat invisible- the inequities and injustices that exist within the issue of climate change go unseen for the most part, as the film highlights when we see impacts of climate change in developing countries. In the US, we have a degree of privilege that shields us from the reality of climate change that other, more vulnerable and less equipped parts of the world are already dealing with and experiencing.



</p><hr>


<p>
Both “The Uninhabitable Earth” and Before the Flood seek to convey the same message while providing numerous accounts and details that legitimize the issue of anthropogenic climate change at hand. While “The Uninhabitable Earth” provides a plethora of drastic effects, Before the Flood helps the viewer to frame the picture and apply it to their own reality. It truly is alarming how we as a species are held accountable for our planet literally dying, yet the majority chooses to stay uninformed in a state of ignorant bliss and do nothing. It is even more unnerving how one of our top environmental activists on climate change is a 17 year old girl, of whom I hold deep respect and admiration for. While Leonardo DiCaprio may not see himself as the man for the job, I thoroughly enjoyed how he portrayed himself in the film. It gave me a sense of relatability and I felt as if it was a learning experience for both of us. DiCaprio also chooses to take a more humble approach and does not allow bias to affect his views. I especially enjoyed the part where he exposes the conglomerate giants and how many will prioritize money over our literal planet and human race. Before the Flood does a fine job of painting the picture of the reality that we all must come to face instead of shying away and being negligent.



</p><hr>


<p>
Watching the film “Before the Flood” brought the climate crisis to life for me. While I can read on the current state of crisis and what future disasters are to come, there is nothing like the imagery of our current damage. The film talks about how we are destroying our environment at such a fast rate that we are reversing half a billion years in evolution. There are three tropical rain forests left, one of them being in Indonesia. In the only places in the world where you could see a tiger, elephant, rhino, and orangutan live in wild, human interest has taken over. Here 80% of forests have been intentionally destroyed simply to make space for palm oil farms. In the last 30 years, 50% of coral reefs have died. A multitude of animal and plant species have been affected by the current changes, and they are only set to get worse. The film states that by 2040 we will be able to sail over the north pole. This is crazy to think about the sea level rise will destroy entire cities. The North Pole is like the AC for the northern hemisphere and as the ice melts, we lose the reflection of sunlight back into the atmosphere which is known as the albedo effect. Not only that but stored methane and carbon dioxide are released furthering the degree of warming on the planet. 
<br><br>
As an American, I feel so blessed but so ashamed at the same time. Here we do as we please and live a life of excess. My waste of resources through daily action is much greater than many people in poorer countries, but it is those same people who will feel the repercussions first. I’ve always thought that people are naturally selfish, and watching this documentary helps me reaffirm that. The American system of politics prevents us from taking direct action into saving the environment because the organizations that fund our congressmen also push for the extraction of fossil fuels. Senator James Inhofe receives the most money from fossil fuel organizations, and he is one of the most prevalent deniers of climate change. We let the greed and pursuit of short term money dominate interests when none of it matters if in 100 years the world has ended due to climate change.

The documentary “Before the Flood” was directed by one of the most well known actors, Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio has been addressing the climate change crisis for many years, and has even become the United Nations Messenger of Peace, essentially making him a very credible source for this film. Throughout the film, DiCaprio travels around the world to witness the effects of climate change first hand, from third world countries such as India, to first world countries such as the US. The audience views the interviews by civilians in third world countries, where the effects of climate change are most severe. It was very hand watching civilians going into tears discussing the enormous effect the change in climate has had on their families and homes. Places around the world are flooding year round, regardless of the season or location, from the Islands in the Pacific, to states in first world countries, such as Florida. This is clearly an outcome of climate change affecting people all over the world, essentially encompassing the severity of this issue. The film addresses all the awful effects of climate change, but ends on a lighter note. One of the last interviews was that of astronaut Dr.Pier Sellers who informs the audience that it is not too late to reverse the effects of climate change. However, we MUST take immediate action before it is too late.



</p><hr>


<p>
In the film Before the Flood, the audiences followed Leonardo DiCaprio to reveal the truth of climate change. It is astonishing that the looming problem is definitely there, but many politicians still tried to play a big rumor to hide the truth to protect their excessive profit. The ice in the north pole is melting in a terrifying speed, the rainforests are burned deliberately burned to create palm oil, the city is submerged into the water. We could not close our eyes any more.
<br><br>
Luckily, there is still a group of people who devote themselves into the work of environment protecting like the Tesla Company. They are inventing the new batteries which used the renewable power to provide enough power for all the people in the world. Besides, on the Paris Summit, the climate change problem got the attention from the whole world for the first time. Though many things have not been implemented like the carbon tax policy, it is still a huge step of changing.
<br><br>
Additionally, this is an impressive film for me because I could feel that something is really happening in my life. When Leonardo travelled to Beijing, he found the terrible air quality there and people were worried about their health. It reminded me of one documentary which called Under the Dome. This documentary basically introduced the harsh air problem in Beijing due to the fossil fuels and many people tried to keep away from the problems. In the documentary, the narrator said that her daughter could only stay at home because the severe haze outside would worsen her bronchitis. The narrator wanted to change the situation for her daughter, that’s the beginning why she created this documentary. I am reflective if we ignored the climate change problem, we are destroying the living condition for our future generation.

After watching "Before the Flood"  and comparing it to Wallace-Well's article, the approaches taken to convey the similar material were obvious but both were more than adequate in expressing their very important messages. By using Leonardo DiCaprio in the film, the audience has an established connection with the film already and it creates a more comfortable and personal experience as they together face the harsh reality shown. By DiCaprio and the team showing exactly the devastating effects of climate change at the very moment, it creates a deeper sense of urgency than the reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" did in some parts, through illustrating on screen just how almost horrifying the reality is, it almost becomes "real" in a sense, in a way that can't always be portrayed in writing. 
<br><br>


Something that really stood out to me was the fact that so many companies can buy themselves into the government and their favor at the expense of people and the future of the planet. Of course companies are based on profit and seek every opportunity to increase their margins, but to see it so blatantly happen was almost scary.

After watching “Before the Flood”, I was left more alarmed than I thought I would be. The fact that there are so many things changing around the world and some people still choose to be ignorant and ignore the change right before their eyes is appalling. I was aware of the ice caps melting which can cause a positive back loop that will end up melting ice into the ocean, changing currents and weather patterns, causing sea levels to rise, and flood-susceptible places to become extremely dangerous. Although I knew this could happen, I didn’t realize it was happening as fast as it is. During the film it was said that by 2040 you will be able to sail over the North Pole. This is only 20 years away which I think is the scariest part. I wont even be 40 yet and a huge part of Mother Earth will have been ruined already. The polar bears will be left with no homes and many other beautiful creatures living there now will have to suffer as well. Not to mention how surprised I was when the scientist showed Leo a 30ft hose, that was once under ice, was now left all exposed as the ice melted away. As these changes intensify catastrophes beautiful places like Florida and Long Beach, CA can be wiped away by floods, leaving people homeless.

<br><br>

This showed me that we must continue to take action in any way we possibly can to help prevent these changes to the environment from getting worse. What made me appalled was when Leo shared that on earth day 2000, he gave a speech addressing the public and policy makers, and 20 year later it did little to nothing. It can be discouraging to know that our country is a huge part of the problem, but it is worth knowing that there are advocates such as Leo that continue to bring awareness to this issue and will stop at nothing. It is also worth noting that there is hope for younger generations to take action in their own unique ways.

It is a good question whether I would like to know the truth of the threat of climate change. In fact, I hesitated a few seconds before I answered yes. It doesn’t seem that it will make a big difference whether I know it or not, but I sincerely hope that most people will choose the same answer, because it would be a lot different if everyone is aware of the severity of climate change and does something to slow it down. 
<br><br>

The film “Before the Flood” is a good start for understanding how climate is changing. For example, we have been hearing that the north pole glaciers are melting, but as the president says, it is an abstract concept, and people don’t really understand the severity of it. The film shows us the perspective of a fisherman who live in north pole, saying that the ice is melting, and it is not like how it was before. Following this trend of melting, the north pole would have no more ice by 2040. It is just 20 years from now, close enough to warn us how important it is to slow down global warming. 

<br><br>

After watching this film, I realized that everything we use in our daily life might cause pollution to the forests on the planet. Companies don’t care about sustainability and burn down countless tree to produce palm oil. The profit they earn is from our daily consumption, which means that we are responsible indirectly for the shrinking of forests. After acknowledging this, I would recommend my friends and my family to purchase less products that contains palm oil. Although it’s just a small step, if this film could be seen by more people, maybe demand of palm oil will largely decrease. If the companies cannot see profit in it, they will try to use cleaner resources. 

<br><br>

This film allows us to see a lot of ongoing processes of climate change. Hopefully, it will alert those people who think that climate change has nothing to do with their lives and start to do something to protect our environment.

In the film “An Inconvenient Sequel”, Al Gore’s work as a passionate environmentalist, often utilizing his experience in politics, to help fight the climate crisis is displayed. Through his speeches in his climate leadership program that focus on the causes and current effects of climate change, discussions with other political leaders around the world, experience at the Paris Climate Agreement, and other first-hand perspectives into his decades-long work, he clearly conveys that he believes that it is morally correct to save the planet. Despite the criticism he has received for his actions, as well as the pessimism that others hold for the world to solve the climate problem altogether, he actively promotes that people should not lose hope in helping mitigate the issue. Stressing that there will be obstacles, but those can be overcome, such as the process of getting the Dscvr satellite into space or solar energy in India, this film serves to inspire everyone, not only his leadership trainees, to participate in the mission to change policies internationally and help the planet.
<br><br>
I honestly did not know too much about Al Gore before watching this film, but after seeing it, I definitely see his passion in publicizing the facts on climate change and the movement to combat it. By the way he delivers his speeches, it is also clear that he is a strong communicator, as he stresses the importance of being aware and active on the issue of climate change. Additionally, I found it interesting that this film focused on the political aspect of climate change as it provides insight on behind-the-scenes of the slow changes that result from a political process in dealing with the issue. However, he seems to only be promoting the use of green energy to combat the problem, while I think that other solutions apart from activism should be mentioned in order to make an impact, especially on the individual level. That being said, overall, this film helps encourage climate activism and delivers on the idea that climate change is an urgent global issue that everyone across the world must work towards solving.

The film "An Inconvenient Sequel" was the film I watched as I've watched the other one, but both Al Gore and Leonardo Di Caprio took similar approaches when it came to climate change, which is by spreading knowledge due to their concern. Gore is no scientist but has been a political character involved in environmentalism for quite a long time, I would even say before it really became a prominent subject matter. Bringing up his political ties might've come off trying to show off, but reveals how that has shaped him into the man today. He is using his political influence to try to engage the public with environmental issues, like the higher sea levels affecting Florida's coast as we speak, but I think he failed to acknowledge the bigger picture which the man he met in India addressed. It's the fact that the US has only been using fewer fossil fuels as of recently and coal was a main source of energy for 150 years and with the use of coal, the US grew exponentially in all aspects. The US has continually put blame on others without taking responsibility for their huge contribution to the climate crisis, having a huge population is not the only problem especially since a person in a less-developed nation emits less than the average American. Some of the environmentally-conscious people tend to forget this fact and try to place blame on a problem that's microscopic on the climate problem. The movement towards the use of solar energy is great, but not great enough of a solution due to the fact that it isn't enough to lessen global warming as there needs to be a change in one's attitudes and habits in developed nations. The ending provided hope for a better world, but there is truly no way of ensuring that without progress in social and lifestyle factors. To simply ignore the climate crisis or say it's of little or no concern is ignorant and shows how inconsiderate certain people are for future generations.

Film: An Inconvenient Sequel
<br><br>
This film is a must watch for people who would like to understand the severity of global warming because the facts that everyone should know unfold in this film. From start to finish, I was really interested in everything Al Gore covered. During the first half of the movie, Al Gore pointed out his personal experiences seeing the government block scientists from using imaging tools to capture daily images of the earth for research. The upsetting part about that was realizing how people in our own government do not consider the problem as a problem. Instead, they look at this problem, deny it, then add to the problem because their priorities are somewhere else. This form of denial inevitably affects humanity negatively, because when people who are in an authoritative position fail to extend their power towards a crisis, it creates bigger issues that will gradually put our safety at higher risk. 
<br><br>
I consider Al Gore as a respectable man for being a well educated advocate for the environment regarding the negative comments he receives. although, I don't understand why people continue to deny his claims when he clearly communicates the facts to the public, as anyone should. you can't deny the data, you certainly cannot deny the footage he captured of the rising sea levels that flooded the streets in Miami, or the video that showed us the terrifying hurricanes in the Philippines. I very much appreciate both Al Gore and Leonardo Decaprio for making such extensive effort to discover the truth so that we may be enlightened. I enjoyed learning from both films, and I hope it grabs more attention from the public.

“Before the Flood” is a captivating documentary that I could barely take my eyes off of once I began watching. I am not the type of person who cares a great deal about what celebrities are up to, what products they’re using, who they’re dating, etc., which is why I was pleasantly surprised at how Leonardo Dicaprio presents himself in a humble and approachable way and learns and grows with the audience rather than coming off as pretentious.The most interesting part of the film which Dicaprio did a great job of explaining was the part breaking down just how much money and the fossil fuel corporations control the media and legislation. It blows my mind that money is still more important to those in power than our actual planet which provides us the resources to be able to make that money in the first place. This is the scary reality of politics and is unfortunately just another corrupt aspect of american society. Although the politics in our country surrounding climate change are not progressive, I am hopeful because people continue to become more and more informed every day and are helping to change the course of politics as we know it today. Since this video came out even, Greta Thunburg has taken the world by storm and has been a pervasive force in combating climate change in the media.

<p>
Before watching the film, I knew of Leonardo DiCaprio’s involvement in advocating for climate change, but was a bit shocked as to how much he has dedicated towards it. I believe that the role he plays as protagonist greatly improves the overall effort taken towards fighting against climate change around the world as his celebrity status encourages more eyes to look into the topic. I feel like the documentary promotes a positive outlook towards the future climate crisis but also enlightens us about its already seen effects across the world in developing countries. 
<br><br>

DiCaprio’s usage of the painting “Garden of Earthly Delights” to set the stage for the documentary really caught my attention. Displaying the themes of over consumption prevalent in modern society despite the alarming effects of climate change in this manner created a sense of reflection within myself about my own destructive habits. 
<br><br>

His conversation with Musk also provides a positive glimpse into a possible solution being gigafactories being utilized by companies in the near future. The 100 benchmark sounds completely feasible given compliance from across the world, and it takes faith not only in humans but the corporations looking to change their carbon footprint. It takes responsibility from people in positions of power, which will have to ultimately be spurred on by a collective effort from people like us.

<p>
The film ”Before the Flood” focuses on Leonardo Dicaprio’s interactions with climate change throughout his lifetime. His role in the film can be a representation of Americans and their views on climate change. One thing that really stood out is learning about the 700 million Indians who don't have access to electricity and therefore don't contribute to the burning of fossil fuels. This is such an alarming example of how developed countries such as the US are leading the greenhouse gas emissions problem while people in developing countries who have contributed significantly less will be the ones to suffer most from the consequences of climate change. 
<br><br>
I think the film does a great job of showing how important politics are in coming up with solutions but more importantly, it displays the problem that comes with politicians denying the science and slowing down any effective action. For any legislative action to be taken there must a consensus in Congress before. 
<br><br>
I think everyone should know the truth of the climate crisis so that they can change their habits whether it be on a small scale or a larger scale from eating less meat to exercising their voting power.

<p>
In my opinion, the film Before the Flood is an attracting and interesting movie. Following the trip with Mr.Dicaprio to many countries, I have a strong sense of urgency to try my best to protect the earth. In retrospect to the last decade, climate change has been a severe issue in our world, and it drastically deteriorated in the following years. Unfortunately, there are still numerous people, including some congressmen and officials, denying the significance of the problem. I firmly believe that in order to solve the problem, everyone should first regard this issue as an important one. Reminiscing about the conversation between Mr.Dicaprio and Dr. Sunita Narain, I was kind of shocked that the USA’s consumption of electricity is so vast that it equals “10 citizens of China, 34 of India, and 61 of Nigeria” (Leonardo). The United States is the most developed country in the world, and other countries seem to be inclined to follow the actions that the USA has been implementing in the previous years. Therefore, I think that US citizens have the responsibility to set an example and change their lifestyles in terms of ways of transportation and production. I feel sad that I heard Greenland is going away if the temperature stays the same. This phenomenon causes me to think that our earth might be in great danger in the next several years.
<br><br>

In addition, I feel shocked that Professor Eshel points out that beef is about ten times more damaging to the environment than any other type of product. I never knew before that cows produce a considerable amount of methane, so I learned a lot of new things by watching this film. I feel a little bit pessimistic about the situation we are in right now, but I believe, like President Obama suggests, we will reverse the situation if everyone does a better job regarding the issue of climate change. This film provides plenty of new information for the audience and warns people about the severe circumstances of a famous person’s perspective. It is more persuasive and convincing. It is a fantastic film, and everyone can learn a lot from it.

The film “Before the Flood” does a well job in explaining the aspects of climate change throughout various perspectives from around the world. Personally, I found it really intriguing that Leonardo DiCaprio used his massive platform in order to bring awareness to such events and I 100% support the contributions of celebrities using their power for real-world issues like climate change. In the film, the audience and DiCaprio explore several changes in different parts of the world that were caused by global warming. Personally, I learned a lot of cool interesting facts and I really enjoyed learning the political spectrum of the climate crisis and how our leaders deny global warming as a problematic issue for other beneficial concerns regarding the economy. Overall, I believe the film does a well job portraying how humans are the main contributors to the problems that the US and the world face today and in the future.

The film “Before the Flood” highlights the impacts that climate has had and will have on the planet, as well as the incompetence of modern society to actually do something for the planet. The film also shows how various government, political, corporal, economic roles have taken a toll on our ability to act out and help the planet because it’s all driven by the greed of the higher uppers and politicians trying to get an extra vote even if it’s at the cost of lives world-wide. I was also a little confused as to why they would name Leonardo DiCaprio as the world messenger of peace, but as they proceeded it started to make sense. Considering he's a major star in Hollywood, it would allow him to have access to many other major icons and high placed officials, actors, and CEO's. He not only would have access to other stars but former politicians, allowing us to see the different perceptions on climate change regarding association and place in society. 
 <br><br>
Before The Flood discusses the topic of the rapid growing rate of the gravity of climate change, and shows first hand the solutions people are currently working on as well as first hand accounts and interviews with big names like Elon Musk and Barack Obama. This film shows the travesty of climate change in a very wide range of countries and different ecosystems, like the Arctic Circle, Florida Coasts, Beijing, South Pacific Islands, and many more; and how this growing rate of climate change not only effects those place getting hotter, but makes other regions colder, as it sucks the life away of many different environments and how this creates a domino effect, affecting hundreds of other places around the world. Before the Flood does a great job of showing the public the all around effects of climate change, and how it affects people everywhere around the globe
   <br><br>
   It's truly disheartening to see how many scientists believe this to be a hoax, and not only their personal belief, but how many others they have brain-washed into believing it's not real. This film really brought to me the clarity of how great the threat is and how politicians and many other high-power officials are treating it so lightly because everyone is so afraid to confront these environmental issues. I want to believe that there will be a future for my kids and grandkids, but this film made me realize that there won't be a chance for them, because of the mediocrity and blatant ignorance from our politicians and others who aren't willing to act. 
   <br><br>
   It also introduced to me the fact that many of these politicians are acting this way, because they're puppets to these large fossils fuel companies whom they receive hefty checks from, so obviously they will do their best to persuade not only the American People but the entire world of this so called scientific impossibility. For instance, when James Inhofe made the bold statement saying, "Global warming is the biggest hoax every perpetuated on the American People." Yet, it's also a little weird how he, being the chair of the senate of the environment committee, makes these bold statements, but he's also one of the largest recipients of fossils fuel money in the U.S senate. These sort of correlations can be made with a large part of the world's politics and these major fossils fuel companies. It makes one wonder if we can truly trust these people who we picked to represent our country.

As I first started watching “Before the Flood,” Leonardo DiCaprio mentions how he feels climate change feels almost like a make believe issue that he would be solving in a movie. This line for some reason strongly resonated with me because there are still many people who don’t believe climate change exists. As the film went on, this became more apparent when the example of Florida came into play. Even though Florida is becoming impacted from rising sea levels, people like it’s state senator refuse to believe in climate change. Florida’s state senator’s vies was surprising to me but what was even more surprising was the fact that Floridians voted for him despite feeling the effects themselves.  It made me want to question why would they elect a man who doesn’t believe in climate change into office when they themselves are being impacted by the effects. If them living the negative effects didn’t sway their mind, what would? 
   <br><br>

Despite this, I thought the film was well thought out. The idea of us learning as Leonardo DiCaprio learned about the fossil fuel industry, arctic melting and countries potentially disappearing made it more personal. It almost felt that I was there with him experiencing these things with him. It also made me feel that I should respond to his call to action as soon as I could.

“Before the Flood” is a powerful documentary that I personally believe is written and filmed in a very effective way that really resonates with the viewer. Leonardo di Caprio establishes himself as a benevolent protagonist who has a credible history in the topic of climate change, but who also acknowledges that he has still has much to learn. Right away the viewer trusts him as a voice of narration and is more willing to accept what the rest of his film has to offer. The first half of the film is grim as it focuses on all of the disastrous paths our world is headed on. In particular, the film highlights the huge negative impacts of major industries (such as fossil fuel, palm oil, and livestock) on the global climate and how much power these industries have over government policies and regulations. It is very disheartening to learn that these industries have the power to restabalize the climate but they instead choose to focus on propaganda against climate change in order to protect their own interests. This film does a good job on showing the bigger picture of the effects of these companies and then also taking it to a more personal level that the viewer can really connect to (for example, the film shows the devastation of the burning of the Indonesian rainforest for palm oil and then also shows the orangutan sanctuary that houses the few orangutans that have survived these fires). By the second half, the film turns to a more positive note, showcasing world leaders coming together to fight climate change, giving examples of countries that have switched to renewable energy, and giving manageable solutions that both countries (such as Elon Musk’s gigafactory) and people (such as switching from beef to chicken) can take in order to make a significant impact. It offers real solutions rather than just inspiring fear in viewers. The film emphasizes that there is still time to make amends and that all hope is not yet lost. Overall, this film is a great introduction to the climate crisis and it leaves viewers with valuable lessons to carry with them in the fight against climate change.

The sequel to Al Gore’s controversial film An Inconvenient Truth, the film An Inconvenient Sequel shifts its focus toward a mostly political outlook. Being a former politician, Gore knows the procedures and employed devices of the political plays concerning climate change. “Big money” from corporations has overridden the democratic foundations of the United States and now they are the ones to call the shots, much to the disadvantage of climate change activists. His mission is to spread the radical message he has formed through his many years of advocacy internationally to empower and persuade many to pursue aggressive courses of action in mitigating the climate crisis. In his work, he encounters many setbacks, some of which is featured in the film, like the forced cancellation of his global climate change broadcast due to terrorism attacks in Paris where the program was being recorded. The implementation of renewables is being rebutted by the climate denying organizations that strive to distort the market to make these environmentally friendly alternatives inaccessible to many. Aside from the political and economic aspects, another main driving force of persuasion in the documentary was the series of footage presenting natural disasters and the first hand testimonials of people who have endured some of the negative side effects of increasing temperatures around the planet. In this ever growing pressure of misery and suffering, more people can come together to rally and solidify their lack of tolerance in waiting for solutions or miracles. Action must be taken now; negotiations in transitioning us to the same page will kickstart the journey to taking back what should be secured for us: a place we can all call our home.

In the film, “Before the Flood,” Leonardo DiCaprio speaks to scientists and listens to their thoughts on what humans can do to decrease their impact on climate change, as well as how climate change is affecting the planet. It was fascinating to learn that some countries mostly rely on solar and wind energy, instead of fossil fuels. For instance, Denmark can (sometimes) produce 100 percent of their electricity. When I hear about accomplishments like this, I wonder why the United States is not doing the same? Why aren’t we making the same efforts to reduce our carbon footprint?
<br><br>

One scientist informed DiCaprio that consuming less red meat would be one good way to reduce our carbon emissions. I know a lot of people who have already cut-out red meat from their diet for health and environmental reasons. Therefore, that is one way that I will personally try to decrease my carbon footprint.
<br><br>


I think it would be nice to see more celebrities follow in DiCaprio’s footsteps and use their large following/platforms to communicate the climate crisis and its threatening outcomes. Overall, this documentary was very interesting to me especially because I was able to hear what scientists had to say about the climate crisis that we are going through.

<p>
Although I already strongly believed in the need to spread more awareness on the pressing issue of climate change, I feel like everyone should watch “Before the Flood”. Even though I have deeply researched and reported on climate change and its effects in the past, the film opened me to an even more extensive view on climate change. Leonardo DiCaprio played a strikingly good role in demonstrating the real-world, visually perceptible extremity of the effects of climate change by visiting melting fields of ice, flying over desolate petroleum-extraction land, and exhibiting the effects agricultural destruction. It is often easy to stomach numbers and facts when there is no visual image to attach them to; no “real” danger to be seen. Through this film, we can be awakened to the truly horrific effects that WE are causing our planet to undergo. 
 <br><br>

I appreciate that the film details specific activities that we can each perpetrate as individuals in order to mitigate environmental damage, but unfortunately, those suggestions end up being few. While the suggestions may help incrementally, I still believe that the only way we can get ahead of our destruction is by joining forces and working together. While there are some global agreements in place, such as the Paris Climate Agreement, there are no consequences to the countries who fail to reach these promises, making them all the more unlikely to become true. I believe we need to make a SERIOUS change in the way we are going about this situation, and it scares me because the human race already disagrees on a multitude of serious issues. It is hard to stay optimistic when I think about all the issues our world is going through, all the violent conflict, all the dissent in fundamental values. However, if a number of major greenhouse-emitting countries (such as the US and China) could sign a possibly consequential document, perhaps we can avoid the utter destruction of our planet. The application of carbon taxes and carbon credits is a good start; but not good enough. Beef consumption needs to be drastically reduced, perhaps by raising the prices or taxes on beef. There are a multitude of viable options that we really could implement; but the initiative needs to first be largely agreed upon in order to properly execute these changes.

"Before the Flood" presents a powerful message about how life on Earth is already facing the consequences of global warming. Within the first few minutes of the film, I was drawn in by the comparison made between the devastation caused by North American hunters in the early 19th century and the destruction caused by today's rapid global industrialization. It is easy to look at the past and recognize the tremendous amount of waste and pollution caused by previous generations. However, as a society we must realize that our current actions are creating an even greater amount of destruction on an even larger scale and at an accelerating rate. I believe this film did a great job at presenting evidence of climate change from various locations across the globe. Although critics and climate change deniers may doubt DiCaprio's credibility as a climate change activist, his ability to include stories from everyday people facing the consequences of global warming is enough to show the real and immediate dangers of climate change. It is unacceptable that industrialized nations such the United States create a significant portion of global emissions and waste while doing very little to create change to promote sustainability. As mentioned in the film, many of the global regions facing the immediate consequences of global warming are areas that create significantly less waste and greenhouse gas emissions compared to other areas in the world. Within the United States, many of us have the luxury to enjoy a lifestyle that often ignores the environmental consequences associated with our everyday actions. I believe that the main message of this film is that you do not need to be an environmental specialist in order to create change. Adjustments to your everyday lifestyle, such as changing your diet or reducing your energy use can be significant. However, a change in our political and economic structure is absolutely necessary to create changes among large industries and our own government. It is essential that people use their voice to express their concerns about global warming to their government officials and large companies. Although the power of one individual may seem small, it is necessary for everyone to view global warming as an individual responsibility in order to see effective changes within our society.

The documentary "Before the Blood" served to be an actual great use of time as it engulfed me into the details of the scary climate crisis that is our unfortunate reality. I appreciated Dicaprio's role of playing a little bit modest with his knowledge of the topic as it made it much more engaging for the viewer to follow and learn with him as the film progressed through conversations with insightful people. With the multiple people that Dicaprio converses with throughout the movie, my favorite had to be his discussion with Elon Musk. Elon is a very sensible man and explains things how they are, his segment in this film being no different. He explains to Dicaprio that the main reason for our excessive pollution and lack of action towards preventing climate change is merely politics and simple economics. 

 <br><br>

With the fossil fuel industry being the most profitable and powerful in the world, there is obvious reason in why we continue to utilize them as an energy resource. Their huge production and wealth stimulate our American economy and with that comes great power through influencing our policies and politics. Musk assures that if actual action is to be made we must first make direct government policy for it such as his proposed "carbon tax". It is a decision that goes against general economics and business ideals in order to sustain the health of our planet and the livelihood of our own species. Once policy is made, extreme climate change prevention can take place. By simply giving giant corporate companies and incentive to start utilizing renewable resources, change can be made exponentially. These ideas and words from Elon truly engage the viewer as they offer insight of climate change from a government and business standpoint, thus making me appreciate the entire film much more as a whole.

Everything is so realistic and definitely more convincing than statistics and data we see in our everyday life. Before The Flood is very impactful and influential, it doesn’t just help people who didn’t realize climate change is a real serious issue to know about what climate change is, how dangerous it is and how is it relevant. For people like me who had the knowledge about climate change before watching this documentary, it brings them closer to see some real impacts on places where disasters occurred. For me specifically, it definitely brought me some anxiety when watching the film, I even let out a long breath as if those things won’t happen again after I closed the page that played the video.
 <br><br>


It also shows and reinforces the fact how politicians have the true power to fight against climate change, but since doing so is going against their interests, most of them chose a path of denying and excusing, worsening the situations. It is certainly not enough of a change even if average people like us can just decide to change our lifestyle starting from now.

“Before the Flood” is a documentary that clearly portrays the climate crisis. Being able to visually see the effects of climate change was slightly different from reading an article. It made the issue seem much more real to me. Some of the scenes that really stood out to me were the scene in Greenland where DiCaprio is shown how much ice has melted and the scene where DiCaprio talks to some farmers that show their flooded crops because the area had received half the year’s rainfall in five hours. Especially the scene of the flooded crops, the severity of the issue and how it is affecting people’s lives is clearly displayed. 
  <br><br>

It was pretty disheartening to learn that the places that are contributing the least to the changes in climate are the ones that are getting hurt the most by the effects of climate change. The film does go over the fact that there are some steps being taken to combat the climate crisis by the countries that contribute the most to climate change, such as China taking steps toward renewable energy. But, with the great power that fossil fuel companies hold in the U.S. political sphere, it will be difficult for any big changes in fossil fuel usage to occur until the dangers of fossil fuels and the climate crisis is well known to the general public. Overall, I think this is a great documentary that clearly portrays the climate crisis and can help spread the severity of the climate crisis.

Former vice president Al Gore has long established his credibility in regards to the climate crisis. He has been working on climate change issues since the 1970s and works with a range of credible scientists. “An Inconvenient Sequel” is extremely inspiring. The movie lists several examples of the consequences of climate change, and I think that Al Gore is the perfect person to deliver this message. Gore is known for advocating environmental consciousness, and his confidence inspires millions. At one point in the film,, Gore talks about how flooding will become a grave issue as the sea-levels continue to rise. He brings awareness to the fact that authoritative figures are ignoring environmental issues. It always shocks me when I’m reminded of how little the people in power care about fixing issues such as homelessness, floods, etc. We have technology such as renewable energy sources to help protect our planet, but the answer to our problems is not that simple. There are some countries that cannot afford to spend money on renewable energy and others that aren’t willing to make any changes to the current systems in place. I relate to All Gore’s comment that there is always a struggle between hope and despair. It saddens me that the United States, a world leader, has decided to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. However, films like “An Inconvenient Sequel” give me hope that change is possible.

After watching "Before the Flood," I can now see how passionate Leonardo DiCaprio is regarding the issue of climate change; before watching the documentary, I merely knew him as a climate change advocate, never realizing that he actually holds the title of UN Climate Ambassador, giving him a large amount of reach and influence and allowing him to speak with notable leaders around the world such as Pope Francis and President Obama. I appreciated his humbleness when he questioned whether he was the right person to be talking about and advocating for such a pressing global issue, especially considering his expertise on the topic after years of personal research into climate change and public advocacy. Footage showing Greenland's ice melting and falling into the ocean in real-time served as a notable example of climate change's current impact on the planet, not just its projected effects. DiCaprio speaking with Obama highlighted the political struggle that America faces because of climate change, considering the heavy impact of public opinion on policymakers and the legislation that ends up being implemented will be the deciding factor in whether or not the United States will take meaningful action to reduce its environmental footprint, particularly concerning agriculture and cattle production. Until now, I was completely unaware of the millions of Indians that don't depend on traditional electrical grids to fuel essential activities such as cooking and the substantial impact placing all of these people on the grid would have on greenhouse-gas emissions unless their electricity came from a sustainable source like solar panels. When looking at China, while their greenhouse-gas emissions may be the highest in the world, I greatly commend their efforts to steer the country towards a greener, more sustainable future that promises reduced air pollution and a much smaller carbon footprint, something that the U.S. would be wise in noting and learning from if humanity wants to avoid utter planetary disaster. Although DiCaprio takes a very general approach towards his portrayal of the problems and efforts surrounding climate change, I think he does a fairly decent job at informing the general public and outlining certain steps that viewers at home can take to reduce their own footprint like switching to a plant-based diet to reduce meat consumption, a message that more people should be hearing and taking to heart.

"Before the Flood" is by far the most compelling and well-made documentaries I have ever bothered to watch. The approach that the film takes is unlike anything I have ever seen, it was a film that I enjoyed to watch because in a sense, I felt that I was going right along with the protagonist, embarking on a journey to learn the most I could on this topic. I appreciate the fact that narrator, Leonardo DiCaprio did not come off as a know-it-all, despite his status as the United Nations Messenger of Peace and respected actor. He humbled himself and allowed himself to see first hand, the environmental injustices that we have caused to our planet. As he traveled the world to find answers, DiCaprio set off to converse with significant leaders around the world, and learned a thing or two from respected scientists. In turn, as a viewer myself I feel that just as Leonardo sat to interview various leaders, and performed hands-on tasks with scientists across the world, so did I. The most compelling thing that I learned from watching the documentary was there are nations such as Sweden that are actively transitioning to being the world's first fossil fuel free nation. That is amazing! However, learning that it is something attainable, something that can be done angers me. It angers me because my own country, The United States Of America, a country that should be a role model, a leader is taking a path in the opposite direction under our current leadership. If Sweden can make the switch to renewable, clean energy than so can my nation.

Even upon the first scene of Before the Flood, I began to see the ignorance of mankind as soon as they said that Leonardo DiCaprio bought into this “global warming hoax”. Thinking about this served as a catalyst towards my developing feelings about climate change. Just watching this short introduction led me to see that the feelings of the media was completely irrational and that they would do anything to avert themselves from this crisis.
 <br><br>

Seeing other people’s perspectives in the films also put into scope the amount of damage that we are doing without fixing it. When the Indian woman was having a conversation with Leonarda DiCaprio, this really hit me due to the fact that one American household was putting so much into the world and that she even said that the US would put a huge whole into the environment. When personally reflecting about this and the way of life as an American citizen, I deemed our actions to be embarrassing. Looking back on our consumption compared to other countries and being able to live so comfortably while others are being affected by this climate crisis is completely unacceptable. 
 <br><br>

In the possibly very near future, we may do irreversible damage to our planet in which would lead to a huge catastrophe for those living after us. This is completely unacceptable due to the fact that we need to look over for the next generations. Seeing that our main political system is being controlled by those in charge of the fossil fuel industry has really shook me to my core because it shows that the people within the system are fueled not by the justices for the general public, but for those at the top of the food chain who have our politicians in their pocket. This is something that should be fixed and something that needs to be looked at more carefully.

<p>
In the documentary "Before the Flood," we see Leonardo DiCaprio traveling around the world, informing himself and others of a crisis called climate change. He has been working alongside climate activists and scientists from a young age and as professor Ken mentioned, was an executive producer of Cal COC as well. Many critics try to discredit DiCaprio, like Fox News, for being an actor who according to them is uneducated on the topic. They believe climate change is a hoax that was invented by the left, and use "scientists" or people with any sort of credibility to rebuke any information that proves them otherwise wrong. These "scientists" have been bought by major corporations that are so greed-driven, they don't care about the long-lasting effects they leave behind; unfortunately, they aren't the only ones being bought. Republican politicians are also being bought by major polluting companies, they receive money in exchange for the dismissal of climate acts and change. They fabricate stats and facts that are aimed at discrediting real scientists who want to bring awareness to our situation. While those people remain in power, nothing will change. 

 <br><br>

Throughout the documentary,  we see how countries contribute to the emission of CO2 and what some are doing to combat their past production of it. China, which surpassed the U.S. as a world polluter, has already begun turning towards the use of clean energy, a change that was brought by the people demanding the government for action. Although, the interview that caught my attention was with the woman named Sunita. She points out the lack of change the U.S. is making, and how the states are so vocal with how the world has to change but aren't making the same effort. She shows DiCaprio how a single American household uses more energy than 34 Indian homes. I agree completely with her statement, but I also believe we can simultaneously work on a solution instead of waiting for one country to do the change first. Lastly, I would like to ask why we haven't changed to Elon Musk's proposal. He states that 100 Gigafactories would be enough to switch to sustainable energy throughout the whole world permanently. If major corporations switched to this business idea instead, they could have the same economic prosperity without dooming the existence of an entire planet altogether. It would be a win-win situation.

Before the Flood gave Leonardo Dicaprio a phenomenal opportunity to showcase his personal passion for saving our collapsing climate while also displaying his acting skills. The movie had a number of very informative and interesting parts that highlighted the complex and multi-faceted nature of the crisis at hand. The section where Dicaprio travels to India was one of my personal favorites because it displayed just how intensely climate change affects different areas of the world in different ways. In the United States, we are accustomed to thinking about climate change in terms of natural disasters such as hurricanes or fires. While this is a very real manifestation of the dramatic consequences of climate change, it only represents a tiny part of the picture for most of the world. In other areas, rising water levels, food shortages, and heat waves are all examples of ways that climate change can ravage different areas.
 <br><br>

I was also intrigued by the section discussing how cows have had a serious impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Not only does the production of beef products require an immense amount of time and energy, but the extremely large amount of cattle held as livestock across the world also requires land, water, and food, all while emitting a large carbon footprint. Overall, I think this movie did an excellent job of being engaging and entertaining while giving an overview of some of the most prominent issues at the center of this issue.



</p><hr>


<p>
The film Before the Flood was definitely not what I expected in terms of how this global issue has so many different perspectives on it. Leonardo used his platform to get this message across. We see things like rising sea levels in Miami, the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and the destruction of rainforests as only the mere surface of the impacts caused by climate change. There has been numerous efforts to reverse these changes, but have been overpowered by the greed of developed countries. At the same time there has been progress made politically with the Paris Agreement but it’s not enough and so I hope this film can help convince individuals to use their voice to make a difference.

The film "Before the Flood" does an excellent job of showing the major issue of climate change. It is great to see Leonardo Dicaprio spearheading this documentary as someone with an established platform and celebrity status to bring more awareness to the issue. I am sure that Dicaprio is more aware of the issues that are brought up in the documentary but as a rhetorical device he portrays himself as being a little more clueless to be a surrogate for the audience watching which I thought was a good rhetorical technique. The documentary is entertaining while being very informational and makes you view that climate crisis in a whole new perspective. One of the most eye opening moments of the documentary of the film is when DiCaprio speaks with Sunita Narain that tells him that there are over 300 million people in India without electricity which she proceeds with telling him that that is the equivalent of the entire population of the United States. Just the idea that that many people live everyday without power that are being affected by climate change while the people who contribute mostly to climate change will never experience the consequences the hardships that people experience that have nothing to do with it.

<p>
The film (An Inconvenient Sequel) brings about the important message of climate change and how in order to make people aware of it, that by taking more of a political stance on things that it will get these politicians talking. Many so deeply in denial don’t want to admit that this issue is a problem partly because they don’t want to admit that he was indeed correct about it. Al Gore constantly reminds his viewers through the harsh reality that mother nature has put people through. If we don’t do anything about this then people will continue to pay the price through an increase of storms getting worse, glaciers continue to melt, and an increase of sea level. I do have a bit of hope for the future because as more people are informed and realizing how most funding is being cut from climate change, that they are willing to do whatever it takes to save whatever is left of the planet.

Seeing the trailer in class I knew it was going to be a ride and honestly that’s exactly how it felt. Just to get this out of the way since most of the focus of the film was about his journey, I appreciate DiCaprio using his influence as an actor/celebrity to educate and spread awareness about Climate Change. Continuing. I had to take several breaks, it felt tiring at times to continue watching multiple breathtaking shots of our Earth in such an awful state of decay. The ways to combat climate change according to the interviewees were either short term goals to help alleviate the effects of climate change on people  by relocating people away from shorelines and building higher roads or long term goals of change in life styles and consumption. I agree 100% on changing the way we live and use resources and taking into consideration who is truly leaving the biggest impact on the planet (big corporations) to reduce our impact on climate change. When we stop blaming poor people for the environment and start realizing it's the big corporations that are screwing us over, I think this is when efforts against climate change will be at it's strongest.
 <br><br>
I had paused the documentary to take a small break and stretch, recollect my thoughts, and really just to give me a break on the heaviness of the documentary. My roommates and I were talking and the conversation shifted to the documentary I was watching for the climate crisis class. I commented on how I would lay back on junk food after learning the palm oil in many foods come from the burning down acres of jungle in Indonesia. That’s when one of my roommates piped up that she didn’t mind it so much to care because if other people get to enjoy things without thinking about the consequences of production to said items then neither will she because she they can then why can’t she Especially if the world will eventually end up dying. Granted it wasn’t as articulate as what I said more so along the lines of “if other people are going to enjoy stuff like that then so can I” and “well we're going to die anyway”. I had to stop and think for a moment. Is this kind of thinking that is leading people away from caring about the environment? Does this stem from selfishness within everyone or is this a conditioning to believe in materialistic gratification (one's pleasures come first)? We certainly don't need junk food to survive let alone be happy so was my roommate's response out of denial of the true magnitude because she has yet to see first hand the negative impacts of catastrophes? Ultimately, I cannot speak for her so I will only say this, not caring about your negative footprint on the world is a privileged and clout chasing thing to say when you keep in mind all the various flora and fauna, and poor communities will pay the price of their lives from the damage you have caused.

I watched "Before the Flood." 
 <br><br>
I liked how they showed different places such as the Arctic, China, and India and how they are suffering from global warming. It is disappointing how India does not have the money or resources to provide clean electricity while the United States has all the money in the world and yet continues relying on fossil fuel. We use so much more electricity per person than many other countries. We must set an example to the rest of the world to show them that we can turn back climate change. 
 <br><br>

They showed how the palm oil industry is burning up the forests in Indonesia. This not only releases carbon but also affects animals such as tigers, elephants, and rhinos that live in these forests. In another part they discussed how beef is a very inefficient use of land and releases lots of methane. I do not think most Americans will agree to eating less beef and people have the right to eat what they want. We could at least try making one meal a day have no beef at all or substituting beef with chicken or fish. 
 <br><br>

Overall, I enjoyed hearing the perspectives of all these people. I liked how Mr. DiCaprio spent his own time to go all over the world to see how climate change has cast such a large shadow on our future.

“Before the Flood” is a powerful depiction of climate change – presenting concrete facts, visible changes in the environment, the opinions of important world leaders, first-hand experiences, and possible solutions in a way that is both alarming but gives some hope for the future. 
 <br><br>
I found the documentary to be much more impactful than any article or reading material that I have seen about climate change. I think one of the biggest reasons for this is because the documentary utilized visuals and first-hand experiences from across the planet in a very effective way. One example is the scene in Greenland with the hose that used to be thirty feet under ice but now is completely over ground. Visually showing how much ice has melted away over five years in Greenland seems to be more powerful than throwing a number of how many cubic kilometers has melted away. Another example is the scene in India which shows the acres of the crops which are now under water after record setting rain seasons. Statistics that show the dangers of climate change are thrown at us constantly, but actually seeing the impact of climate change seems to be able to bridge the gap between reality and impact in a more powerful way. 
 <br><br>
The segment about the negative consequences of the mass consumption of beef was very eye opening for me. I did not realize how inefficient the process of consuming beef is – the fact about how mass amounts of methane is released into the atmosphere from cattle is one that I feel should be publicized much more. Every molecule of methane is equal to TWENTY THREE molecules of CO2 which shows that is much more dangerous than CO2 in the atmosphere. The majority of methane consumption is due to the way that we grow livestock. Though people may feel that it is too late to do anything to save the planet, or that there is nothing an individual can do to help, this segment clearly shows otherwise. If we even cut a quarter of our consumption of beef, the impacts would be tremendous. Considering the fact that in order to make a ½ lb burger is compared to 200 hours usage of a lightbulb, cutting our consumption of beef should be very feasible.
 <br><br>
The documentary also does a good-job of providing hope for the future. The segment with Elon Musk and the Gigafactory really stood out to me. Musk discusses the power of batteries in creating sustainable energy – he also states that a hundred gigafactories across the world would be enough to transition the entire world to sustainable energy. Though Tesla cannot do this alone, only a hundred gigafactories across the world in exchange for sustainable energy seems like a very realistic goal to reach. 
 <br><br>
Lastly, I really liked the way that the documentary started and finished by showing the painting “Garden of Earthly Delights”. At the end of the documentary, DiCaprio says that we are currently in the second panel of the painting, and if we don’t act fast enough we will end up in the third panel. However, there is still time to last in the second panel and protect our future on the planet.

<p>
I believe the film, “Before the Flood,” did an excellent job in highlighting the dangers of climate change. It effectively gave the message that every one of our actions has a consequence. And although DiCaprio was likely more informed than he showed, by using this rhetorical device it simplifies and breaks down the situation for the audience, allowing them to fully grasp the severity of the climate crisis. Breaking down the situation along with the visuals will help many better understand the situation.

The film, "Before the Flood", presented a very intimate perspective on the issue of climate change and its global impact. I found that Leonardo DiCaprio's presentation of the dismal future our planet is facing was very interestingly complemented with a recurring theme in which everyone, including himself, has a responsibility in reflecting on the impact of our daily activities. He opens the film with a personal look at his life and its recent occurrences, including being fascinated by the topic of the Earth and being deemed a climate ambassador by the UN. He takes us along his journey of going to different parts of the world and learning of the destruction inflicted on various people due to human activities and economies addicted and driven by the cheap accessibility of fossil fuels. He even brings up the matter of diet, highlighting the large amount of land that is used in order to raise livestock and grow the feed for these animals. These environmentally harmful activities are activities that are the product of consumer choices that fuel the daily routines of the entire human population, decisions we don't normally think twice about. Examples of these are using gas to fuel cars, buying and supporting large corporations that have their supply of product from destructing habitats, and even our food choices that are inefficiently using our continuously depleting resources.
 <br><br>
I felt that the film gave a deep look into how life has changed due to climate change. While watching this movie, I felt the viewer was given visual evidence of the desperate need for action to be taken in order to save our planet. Leonardo took the audience on a journey across the globe as he visited habitats that are basically waiting an impending doom. He reinforces the image of the dying planet which I felt strengthened his argument that climate change is not a hoax and that there is more than enough evidence of its existence and impact on the wellbeing of every living thing that inhabits it. However, I found the segment on the illusory nature of media to be very eye opening. The people are given skewed opinions from people of power due to the preventative measures taken by large corporations, in order to secure the profitability of their industry. Through the use of bribery to those who hold seats in the government, they are effectively able to ensure that no laws or anything will stand in the way of their opportunity to make as much money as possible. I felt that this demonstrated the need for individual reflection and realization. We cannot choose to believe everyone or anyone without investigating ourselves and creating our own perspective. There is a need for every individual to care about the planet on which their livelihoods depend on. This social responsibility is not dependent or proportionate to where anyone lives or the type of lives they currently have. Without a collective effort, in the impending future, none of it will matter if we are left with a planet that is no longer able to sustain life. For instance, just because the US does not experience the same health risks as China at this point in time does not mean that we will be safe from it in the future. We have yet to personally endure the negative consequences that come with the pollution from human activities which may also explain why there is even a debate on the existence of climate change in the US. We still have the luxury to calmly discuss whether or not climate change is a hoax because we don't personally feel the effects compared to other countries. But this doesn't make any sense as to we are one of the countries that has the resources to do better for the other people in which we share the planet with. It is ignorant and negligent, not only for us but out of moral righteousness. I felt the film highlighted the need for action by every individual before it is too late, even though it may already be so. The film demonstrated the vast amount of destruction we have bestowed upon ourselves and that there is no time left to waste.

The documentary Before the Flood presents the effects of climate change and gives the viewer simple solutions in how they can directly impact the crisis by reducing their emissions. Although seeing the effects of climate change is much needed to persuade people to change their actions,  the latter part of the documentary had the most impact on me since it motivated me to make changes in my life to reduce my carbon footprint. 
 <br><br>


One clip where a Fox News commentator tried to discredit DiCaprio for trying to be an advocate when his only credential is acting was very ironic to hear, especially when they are known to support at the time presidential candidate Trump who has the same credentials and since then has made actions that has contributed to the climate crisis. When DiCaprio talked about the climate crisis at his award acceptance speech it seemed quite unexpected at the time to hear him say that, but clips from this documentary have shown me that he has actually been advocating for many years prior. It is reassuring to know that there are solutions out there and people bringing awareness to both the problems and solutions.

<p>
In my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio’s lack of a strong scientific background is what makes him a very useful advocate for climate change.  He is first a concerned individual about the environment and the consequences we face as a result of global climate change.  DiCaprio uses his enormous platform amazingly to raise awareness about the perils we face in the very near future from global warming.  His status as a “household name,” greatly brings attention to his intense apprehension for the state of our environment, something his many fans will notice.    His film, “Before the Flood” provides an interesting take on the climate crisis that is easily accessible to an audience that may not have an advanced understanding of the science behind climate change.  Seeing as the majority of the population will not be well-versed in scientific academia, a documentary like “Before the Flood” would be a good start in understanding the breadth of the climate crisis while at the same time have an enjoyable experience watching a documentary on climate change.  DiCaprio did a very good job in extending a bridge of information about this very important issue to the masses.

In the film “Before the Flood”, DiCaprio,
the United Nations Messenger of Peace, interviewed many people, from Barak
Obama and the Pope, about climate change. During recent years, the release of
carbon dioxide posed the threat of global warming. The two question is becoming
increasingly important-“what is the consequence of global warming” and “what
can be done to slow it”. My opinions are mainly the answers of these two
questions.
 <br><br>

The consequences of global warming are not only horrible, but also multi-perspective. Rising sea level increases the possibility of washing away the product of farmers. Forests and oceans absorb most of the carbon dioxide away. However, the absorbed greenhouse gas is
damaging ecosystem- half of the coral that a billion people rely on is killed. In the forest, fire increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the air.
 <br><br>

A world transition from heavy use of fossil fuel to solar and wind energy is urgent. China and the U.S. are the two largest emits in the world. Since China is taking the lead role of using renewable energy, the U.S. should follow its steps. This is to enlighten less developing
country a workable way to provide access to energy to more of the poor, such as
India. India is using lots of fossil fuel simply because of its low price. It
is encouraged to invest more on development on new technologies of renewable
energy, such as gigafactories.
 <br><br>

There is no doubt that documentary is an effective tool to promote the effect of climate change because of the experts and vivid image. Vivid images in the video express the horrible melted ice and forest fire in an impressive way. Experts add authorities to the video.

After watching the documentary "Before the Flood" I was able to further enhance my ideas on the climate crisis. Leonardo DiCaprio, a famous Hollywood actor, is used to appeal to the public's attention so that they are more intrigued when watching the film, and hey it worked on me. Huge weather problems are caused and are seemed to be the new norm for the future if we keep our carbon footprint up. We are looking forward to more droughts, rising ocean levels, coral bleaching and many other environmental catastrophes. In my opinion none of this is going to change because the CEO's of corporations only care for themselves and their families rather than the rest of the world. Large corporations are the reason for most of the harmful substances that are released into the atmosphere and politicians are quick to defend them because they are wealthy and have more power than the average person. However this changes when public opinion changes just like how Obama used to stand against gay rights and then switched over when the polls were changing. I feel that since most of the energy we used on a daily basis comes from fossil fuels, large corporations are scared to try something new because it might affect their profits and supporters. We need more people like Elon Musk because he's trying to find new ways to use renewable energy that is better for the environment. I might want to buy a Tesla lol.
 <br><br>
I know that switching to a plant based diet is better for the environment however I'm not going to completely switch over because I love all foods and can't give up meat so easily, I will switch to a more sustainable diet and reduce food waste. Overall I enjoyed watching the film and am going to bug my family about it.

Watching "Before the Flood" was truly an eye opening experience to the reality and pace of climate change. Though I am not sure how much Leonardo DiCaprio represents environmental activism and whether he is an apt spokesperson for climate change but through this film, his strive for advocating immediate action is well appreciated. It is not often you see celebrities using their impact to genuinely do something monumental regarding environmental awareness. Celebrities might make comments or slight donations to natural disaster causes, but rarely putting in enough time effort and most importantly money to significantly impact our future. Though this film didn't pause climate change, it shoves more people into the right direction and gives a powerful reason to constantly keep global warming in mind. I can appreciate how the film makes it easier for a broader audience to digest and understand without diluting the gravity of the situation.  The film doesn't delve right in to the heart of global warming, instead it starts with explaining why the situation is often overlooked and why most of us aren't aware of the graveness and severity of our future and presence. I think the transition from that explanation to the actual discussion of the extremity global warming has reached is extremely important to the argument because without debunking the disbelief of global warming, how can we truly put a face to a bunch of science we hear about that no one else is taking seriously. More importantly it is crucial to make aware that just because most everyone isn't extremely worried doesn't mean we must all live in ignorance, for that is just speeding up the process of the end of our earth.

Watching the documentary, “Before the Flood,” was very insightful in understanding what implications climate change has had on individuals on a global scale. As DiCaprio travels to different countries, we are able to see how they have taken action to prevent further effects of climate change. I found it amazing that the most populated countries such as China and India have taken a more renewable approach in the way they run their economy just by beginning the switch from coal to renewable forms of energy. Yet the United States continues to be the country with the largest carbon footprint and has not taken the same measures as other countries, as if they are cleaning up the mess the US has and continues to make. As it was stated in the documentary, politicians follow what the people say and specifically, what the polls indicate. Realizing that the people hold power, however, does not mean much if no action is being taken to solve this issue but today it gives me more hope as more public awareness on climate change is being made. It is concerning to think about the effects climate change had when this film was made four years ago. Leonardo DiCaprio having to travel to the other end of the earth to find snow because the warmth had melted what was supposed to be his set is so bizarre since these implications must be so much more advanced today. This documentary successfully portrayed the different catastrophes that have increased in recent years in hurricanes, floods, wildfires, etc. as well as projects being made in regards to these events. This makes me think and question where we would be today if we had listened to climate scientists from the beginning in taking action to prevent climate change from happening and becoming so extreme.

<p>
This may be a slight hyperbole but watching this film felt like a rollercoaster ride. Not only because actually seeing the impact with your own eyes instills so much more emotion than reading a piece of text. This is why I enjoyed actually watching "Before The Flood" more than reading "The Uninhabitable Earth". While I was able to get a lot of information and statistics in the article reading, watching before the flood and actually seeing the melting of the glaciers, the cropland that was overflooding and ruining the crops, the farmers that were effected by the crops, and the people who live on the islands that are soon to be flooded instilled emotions in me that the uninhabitable earth reading simply cannot.

 <br><br>

Watching this film was not only a rollercoaster ride in terms of emotions, but also in terms of how I viewed these issues and what policies I believe in. After watching the film I concluded with: It's complicated. After a portion of the movie that was talking about anti-corporation and news outlets misinforming the public and attempting to confuse the general populous, I thought to myself screw all those people we need to go 100% into renewable energy, the world needs to rise up! After watching more of the film, I realized it's way more complicated than that. Not only are other countries such as China doing better than the United States in renewable resources, China and India have a very high population of citizens without electricity. One quote that resonated with me was "Coal is cheap whether we like it or not." The fact that these countries, who are significantly poorer than the US and have much better things to worry about are better with energy usage is disgusting. I left the movie with the conclusion, it's complicated, because us Americans need to focus on ourselves before looking to other countries to do better.

I first watched this film three years agos and remembering nothing about it I figured it was fairly safe to watch it again. After watching, I was suprised that I forgot. The effect of seeing the movie was a strong the second time as the first.
 <br><br>
As Ken Hiltner mentions in this video, what stands out the most to me is the structure of the movie. In my AP Environmental Science class in highschool, where I first watched this movie, I saw firsthand the effectivness of this strategy. Unlike most climate change documentaries, many of which I enjoy very much so this is not to complain about them, this movie takes special care to be relateable to the audience. The writing uses enough science to stress the gravity of the situation to the common viewer, but not too much messy jargon that might confuse or alienate its audience. It does not take a specific side, instead focusing on the uniting factors of climate change and reporting on stories that many can either relate to or empathsize with. For example the segment focused on Miami’s seasonal flooding. Watching a town that many Americans know struggle with the real time effects of climate change from a community and city planning standpoint is incredibly moving. It forces the viewer to consider how their own town and family would deal with the major changes climate change might bring. 
 <br><br>
Additionally, the use of such a famous actor as Leonardo DiCaprio is a good choice as well. I’m aware that DiCaprio being in the film was less of a stylistic choice than a practical one, but it works nonethless. What many people often complain about when it comes to works focusing on the climate crisis is that the feel that they are being preached at or talked down to. For example in documentaries like “Earthlings” where viewers may feel graphic imagery is being shoved at their faces to make them feel guilty. “Before the Flood” is built to be uniting and sympathetic to the audience. Many may feel that their narrorator or author is biased in one way, or is unlike them. Using DiCaprio as the “protagonist” is smart in that it forces the audience to connect a sympathetic face to a divisive issue. And his star power ensures that the film will be watched, spreading the message beyond viewers who truly care about the climate crisis to casual viewers who are curious what a famous movie star is doing in a “nature documentary.”

The film gives an overview of the consequences, diplomacy, and inaction on climate change all presented by Leonardo DeCaprio. Visits to fossil fuel extraction sites, disappearing islands, foreign renewables megaprojects, and UN conferences all provide primary sources on the issue and communicate the views of its stakeholders exceptionally to viewers. It discussed the nature of the climate change threat we face today and possible solutions to this global problem. The film was effective in communicating the urgency that we need to avoid the most critical parts of climate change as well as the significance of how much needs to be done to bring down CO2 emissions. 

 <br><br>

Such videos have been influential in demonstrating how much affect we have on our planet. This film showed the ugly reality of our addiction to fossil fuel with trips to tar sands and techniques of cutting and burning in Indonesia. The movie also had more positive interviews such as the one with Elon Musk about how 100 Gigafactories would be necessary to meet the world's energy needs. Such illustrations and interviews conveyed his message successfully together. I saw this film's audience as people who are familiar with climate change and environmentalism, but perhaps somewhat more vague about the nuances of what they can do to contribute and what the world's current situation is.
 <br><br>
Personally, watching this film I felt quite emotionally negative. Although this film presented positive steps that we could take, I felt as if the political opposition to the change in the climate was correctly depicted as an almost inevitable challenge to overcome. However, throughout the film, the narrator (Leonardo DiCaprio) annoyed me.
 <br><br>


He's a white, wealthy man with no scientific training and a very Western background seeking to be a voice of environmentalism, and while he admits that, his narration always comes with all that racism. While I agree that figures in popular culture can help raise awareness about problems, I also thought that DiCaprio was still very cynical and tone-deaf to many real issues. I would have loved if this documentary focused a lot less on irrelevant wealthy white dudes, and focused more on activists who are working in their communities to balance with environmental issues and basic resource needs. 
 <br><br>


Overall, this film reminded me of the severity of climate change and kept me feeling fairly pessimistic about our future as a species. It almost reminded me of how important Environmental Justice is. The wealthy will outlast the poor simply because they can afford to deal with climate change. I see that fact as a fundamental inequality that must be changed.

<p>
The wonderfully persuasive and informative film, “Before the Flood,” approaches the issue of getting people to act on the climate crisis in a very appropriate, yet clever, way. I believe that having the film set up with the viewer living through Leonardo DiCaprio through his journey to find answers was very captivating and convincing. The viewer can relate to DiCaprio when he asks questions and acts less informed than who he interviews. Even though this may just have been a smart tactic by the producers, it makes the film that much more convincing to the audience. 
 <br><br>

The most interesting part of the film, in my opinion, is when DiCaprio speaks with Sunita Narain, a woman who works with science and the environment in Delhi. He addresses the shocking fact that there are 300 million people without power in India, and follows by stating, “Thats equivalent to the entire population of the United States.” This is a very controversial point in the film because obviously working to address the climate crisis is necessary; however, so is improving the lives of the humans currently surviving without power. Narain brought up very interesting points while explaining her response to when Americans ask why India isn’t making environmental advances in energy. She said, “If it was that easy, I would have really liked the U.S. to move towards solar, but you haven’t.” This controversial point highlights American’s ignorance of our own damage to the world and shows how we try and pin our mistakes on others. We are, afterall, one of the worlds greatest polluters with a fraction of the population. 
 <br><br>

After watching the film, I was so inspired to make a change. I sent a message to my friends and family urging them to watch the eye opening film. The people that DiCaprio meets with and the facts he learns along his journey make this film very successful, captivating, and educational.

<p>
This film didn’t strike me as terribly different from several other climate change documentaries in terms of the facts it presented. However, the emotional punch it packed literally moved me to tears. I’ve known for quite some time that I wanted to protect the environment, but beyond that I think that most of the youth want to address the climate crisis. Seeing how far the issue of climate change has been allowed to progress, it sometimes feels like we’ve lost before we even got a chance to step onto the field. That’s why, when I find a piece of hope on this topic, I cling to it. Al Gore gave me hope. His speech on all the other just movements in history inspired me, and his display of what can be done made me feel hopeful. And then the film cut to Donald Trump pulling out of the peace accords, and a strong frustration took over. It disappoints me that, with a massive global problem, whose centuries-long course will likely be decided in the next decade, the biggest contributors to the issue chose a leader who doesn’t even believe there’s a problem to begin with. What we need is a real leader, someone like Al Gore.

"Before The Flood" does a great job of bringing awareness and real urgency to take action. Leonardo Dicaprio as a well-known celebrity keeps the audience engaged brings credibility and attention to this documentary. He perfectly exemplifies the importance of public figures using their platform to inspire change and focus attention on serious issues.  The documentary presents various regions to show widespread climate change and a growing consensus among leaders and people from various nations. The visuals presented also demonstrate an effective emotional appeal to make viewers feel and reflect on the change that needs to happen. Overall this film does an exemplary job of keeping individuals aware of climate change dangers and how changing small aspects of your lifestyle such as the food you eat, the car you use can make a huge difference in preventing CO2 levels from rising.

<p>
The Film (Before the Flood) was amazing. 
 <br><br>
To begin with, the approach the film used to deliver the message to its audience was really effective. I loved that they made Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a huge movie star, come off as really relatable. He starts off by saying how pessimistic he is about our future in fighting climate change, and how he feels like the U.N. might have chosen the wrong person. This made him come off as a really down to earth (and realistic) person, which helps since the movie relies on following DiCaprio around in his journey to learn more about climate change to deliver its message. 
 <br><br>
Furthermore, the movie was very well produced. It felt like more of a story than a lesson on climate change. I think this is important because like DiCaprio said, no one wants to hear about climate change. The movie did a great job in engaging the audience in this way. 
 <br><br>
Overall, most of the information presented in the film was stuff that I had heard of before, but the way in which it was delivered reinvigorated my interest in the subject and wanting to do something about it.
 <br><br>
There were a couple of parts in the movie that made me uncomfortable. Throughout the movie you get a look at different companies and countries who carelessly continue to  be part of the problem despite things like melting ice sheets, and extinction of species occurring in real time.The snippets of fox news really made me want to stop watching, as it is really depressing seeing grown men in suits look straight into a camera, with a serious face, and deny climate change. A particular snippet of Sean Hannity ridiculing DiCaprio for speaking on the subject of climate change when he is not a scientist, while at the same time discounting the majority of scientists who agree climate change is happening.
 <br><br>
This was balanced out by seeing inspiring things like Tesla's giga factory, which I saw as an inspiring step toward a brighter future.

<p>
The film Before the Flood was a very insightful documentary and I found that it effectively summed up the material that we have learned thus far. This film conveys that our generation has a real problem on our hands. Climate change is both a threatening and serious problem. The film not only showed important pieces of evidence that proved that climate change is indeed happening but it also showed how people can help make a difference and provided the science and in depth explanations of what's causing and reinforcing this phenomenon today.
  <br><br>

Prior to watching this film I had no idea that Leonardo Dicaprio was a UN messenger of peace. This was very inspiring because it showed that at least some people in the generation above us care about the damage that is currently being caused. However, on the other hand, there are many people who ignore the clear evidence and deny that climate change even exists. It is unfortunate that people (many with a lot of power) like Marco Rubio believe that climate change is a hoax. This is unfortunate because there are many things we as a society can do to help combat this problem. Things like switching to sustainable energy or even changing the food production system can have such an enormous impact on the future generations of all life on Earth. We might not be able to fix the damage we have already caused but we can stop further damage and save this planet before it becomes  too late. The only problem is that everyone must be on board for us to effectively make this change.
  <br><br>

Lastly I enjoyed Leo’s presentation of the climate problem through the use of the painting in the documentary.  We may have lost the original paradise we once had but we are in the middle panel and if we continue to repeat our mistakes we will end up in the last panel and have destroyed what was once a paradise.

<p>
Film (Before the Flood)- From start to finish of this eye opening film, I will admit that it was a bit difficult to believe that DiCaprio didn’t know everything he claimed to have no knowledge about when it came to the issue of climate change. For one, prior to the making of this film, Leonardo DiCaprio had already been named the Messenger of Peace and asked to speak at various global warming events back when it was still called by the name of ‘global warming’. However, his genuine wonder and reactions and astonishment towards certain pieces of information he was receiving was refreshing to see as I myself was also learning new information that I would have most likely not even looked into. 
    <br><br>

There is that advantage, I think, that this film had, with knowing that the majority of the audience who would be watching this film wouldn’t exactly be experts on the subject of climate change. Therefore, those watching can connect to the feelings of hopelessness and despair that DiCaprio shows when speaking with experts on how little time we as the general public have to reverse the consequences of our actions even a small percent. 
  <br><br>

Listening to DiCaprio speak to the mayor of Miami Beach was especially hard to watch due to the fact that all the money being invested into the new pipeline project, specifically $400 million dollars, was not to actually resolve or better the issue of the ongoing climate change but to lessen the damage of what it’s already wrought on the people of Miami beach. Everywhere, there are innocent people reaping the consequences of actions not their own and with every one of DiCaprio’s interviews, that became increasingly clear.



</p><hr>


<p>
The"Before the Flood" provides viewers with an oversimplification of the disaster that climate change has brought to our civilization. Human beings should not blame the earth for their own actions driven by greed, power, and politics. Leonardo DiCaprio is the moderator and discusses with experts in different fields their experience in solving or responding to the problems facing the world caused by the climate crisis. This film explains the different phenomena very effectively, because the experts talk to DiCaprio as a person rather than trying to explain it to the public. 
  <br><br>
Politics play a large role in the global warming crisis. Many American politicians are full of ignorance that cannot comprehend the impact our society is doing to the planet. Maybe we are ignorant, we don't care so much about the environment. In these busy times, we only care about our immediate interests, and those politicians are just our epitome. When we are more visionary and educated, we will not be so easily stunned by our interests and will not be easily incited.Although it takes time, the professor is trying to tell more people the truth.


</p><hr>


<p>
The film Before the Flood begins with Leonardo DiCaprio stating that he feels the UN may have picked the wrong guy to be given the title Ambassador of Peace because of the pessimism he feels when looking at the earth’s future. I find this fact comforting. Though DiCaprio feels frightened about the future, he does not give up hope and still embarks on a journey in search of knowledge and solutions to the current climate crisis. 

  <br><br>

The main enemy is fossil fuel. This energy source is ingrained into our society and in order to satisfy our addiction, we go to devastating lengths. In the film, whole forests and rich ecosystems are being destroyed completely to obtain fossil fuels. With this as our main energy source comes polluted air, the loss of biodiversity, ecosystem collapse, climate change, and many more negative consequences. The film brings up a very important fact which must be emphasized, “there is no such thing as clean fossil fuel.” Those in charge of fossil fuels organize hatred and fear in order to divide the public in an attempt to dispute science. In the eyes of key players such as Koch industries and Exxon, the fleeting profit made from fossil fuels is worth the complete destruction of the planet. In order to protect the wealth, they must dismiss climate change and a too large portion of the public believes them. A great point in the film states that the ocean is not democratic or republican, all it knows how to do is rise and it will.  

  <br><br>

One main issue in my opinion when it comes to trying to get people to see climate change as a pressing issue is that they feel it does not directly affect them. In many cases like in the United States, it can often be difficult to gain a sense of empathy for the rest of the affected world. When DiCaprio visits India, it becomes clear that the more poor populations of people in places like India, Bangladesh, and Africa are the first to experience the horror of climate change. This, however, will not be enough to convince the population of the disaster that is climate change because historically, it is a disgusting fact that no one cares for the poor. Another example from the film is the melting of the arctic and Greenland. These regions are far away and we feel like it doesn’t affect us, so it is simple to not worry. What is not realized, however, is that the arctic is like air conditioning for the northern hemisphere. Without it, there is a change is ocean currents, weather patterns, and this leads to catastrophic weather events that certainly have a large chance of affecting you. There is no arguing science. The beginning of catastrophic climate change related events are maybe not enough to convince everyone yet, but by the time they are too apparent to deny it will be too late.

In “Before The Flood,” Fisher Steven takes the audience into a journey of understanding climate change, and specifically America’s role in it. He uses Leonardo Dicaprio, a well-known Hollywood actor to introduce the consequences of climate change and humanity’s influence. In doing so, Dicaprio becomes representative of the environmentally-concerned people. However, Leonardo is quick to acknowledge any doubts the audience may have for his role in the documentary, as well as being the face for climate change-activism. By doing so, Dicaprio establishes credibility because he is able to address the criticism against him and progressively introduce why he makes the best candidate for discussing climate change throughout the film. Dicaprio even uses his role in an upcoming film, “The Revenant” to discuss how pressing climate change is on our weather--he discusses how finding snow to complete filming, they had to transport 200 people 9000 miles away, “it was a warm winter.” 
  <br><br>

While the documentary’s title places an emphasis on floods, it also discusses the different effects that climate change will have on earth besides rising sea levels. Alongside Dicaprio, Steven takes us on a journey to different parts of the world: Sweden, China, India, Bahamas and so on to introduce the idea that climate change is a global issue. Not only that, but they hold conversations with different environmentalists, where they carry raw opinions on climate change and its relation to anthropopeia. Sunita Narain, an activist for the centre for science and environment, holds no hesitation when she says America continues to point at other countries for failing to take action, despite not taking action themselves. Climate change is a prevalent issue that is only getting worse. Steven Fischer and Leonardo Dicaprio embark on a journey to uncover the truth behind climate change and whether people are taking the action necessary to delay its consequences. They are even able to hold discussions with great figures like Elon Musk, who makes you believe for a second that worldwide renewable energy is possible, and it may be if certain protocols and laws are made by congress. Carbon tax stuck out immediately when watching the documentary. While I do understand the controversy that goes into raising any tax, I think this one is necessary and would be very beneficial in the long-run. But as the documentary portrayed, powerful people who financially benefit from greenhouses-funded projects will not let that happen. It was interesting to also see the former president’s opinion; Barack Obama also agrees that climate change is not a hoax and should be a concern for both a sentimental and unsentimental audience. One idea that stuck to mind throughout the film was “Imagine the world right now if we had taken the science of climate change seriously back then.”

In Before the Blood, the struggle of environmental protection began quickly under VP Al Gore, but failed to reconnect the public with environmetnal scene. It was interesting to see the perspective of government in the struggle, especially when dealing with public and their opinion. DiCaprio played a good ambassador for the change of climate crisis, and played a role that was important to the movie. 

  <br><br>

“Before the Flood” is made to present serious environmental problems. It is impressed that Greenland ice sheet had been melt to a great extent due to global warming. Just within five hundred years, hundreds of cubic kilometer of ice had already become water. Moreover, it the global warming remains, it is going to disappear. The content of the movie strives to find out ways to alleviate the problem of global warming, including how to stop the rising sea level, investigating renewable energy, and immigration. It raise people’s awareness of the current environmental problem and appeal to people to environmental protection.

I watched the documentary film “Before the Flood,” I think the approach of the film is unique. It reveals the truth about climate change by following a great Hollywood start, which I believe is to appeals to more audiences. It is said that a well develops country like the US did not act enough to prevent climate change. The US government is partially controlled by the Business interest, which seems unethical to me. Although it is a benefit for the country with a political party to restrict the false to happen in some cases, I saw the disturbing aspect in such a system.
   <br><br>

In the film, it also talks about switching to the vegan diet. I think such a solution is very beneficial for the world and both the citizens. Despite the fact that some people must hunt to live their life, people who have more choices can easily apply a more vegan diet into their daily life, which is also suitable for their health. I am already a vegan, and I learned some nutrition knowledge before that having a vegan diet can actually prevent lots of diseases and sometimes reverse cancer and heart diseases.
   <br><br>

I am majoring in film at UCSB, and I already made some short film project about a vegan diet and reveals the environmental factors about it. The methodologies in this film are useful for me to learn and make more thought-provoking films in the future.

In Leonardo Dicaprio's documentary film "Before the Flood," I learned that the issue of climate change isn't something simple and shouldn't be deemed as a problem that is not that big of a deal. The planet is being affected by the environmental damages that were caused by oil industries and carbon emission processes going on in industrial corporates. One of the most infuriating components that were revealed in the documentary and that should be spread across the audience is that the United States is not being very responsible in midst of all this disaster. The United States is the number 2 country of this planet that produces the most damages onto this planet for the industrial companies' activities involving oil and etc. However, many people in public are ignoring this issue that is unaware that these damages are affecting everyone across the globe. For example, poorer countries are affected because such environmental damages are causing harm on their crops, and homes. Despite all the damages the poorer countries are facing, the wealthy does not take responsibility at all. 
   <br><br>

Also, I would like to point out that Leonardo DiCaprio is a very great ambassador for climate change. He constantly tries to remind the public what our actions are doing to the environment around us. He is a perfect example of a wealthy celebrity, but still he puts effort into this issue and reminds the public that it is significant not only to the people today but also to the future generations.



</p><hr>


<p>
After watching “Before The Flood”, I was taken aback at how badly climate change is ruining our planet, along with the inaction that is followed by it. As the film connected personal stories, scientists, and politicians to the issue of climate change, it showed how serious this crisis is. I felt ignorant and ashamed after watching it, as I learned how my own meat consumption and support of products is contributing to the growth of climate change. Learning that 10-12% of US emissions is due to beef is startling and calls for change. This film encouraged me to go back to being vegetarian and one day becoming vegan. While many think that one person going vegan won’t stop climate change, this film taught viewers that every action is important and it all contributes to our global carbon footprint. Consciously not consuming meat, not buying harmful products like palm oil, and voting for politicians who support policies like a carbon tax are all easy ways we can contribute to stopping climate change. 
    <br><br>

As a Catholic, I was very glad to see Pope Francis speaking out on such an important topic. While religious leaders tend to stay out of politics, the fact that the Pope spoke out shows how urgent the climate crisis is becoming. This film showed that people of all beliefs have to come together to make the earth more inhabitable for future generations. If more people took the time to learn that 97% of climate scientists say that the earth is warming, they would be more inclined to make this a bipartisan issue. As I learned that senators and congressmen take money that comes from fossil fuels, I was angered when I thought about all of the policies that have been stopped for monetary gain. 
    <br><br>

Ultimately, America must step up and become a leader in reducing fossil fuel emissions. As a powerful and developed country, others look to our lead when making policy decisions. When we let greed and deceit get in the way of political change, we are only aiding the growth of climate change. Americans throughout the country must get involved and angry, creating a better future for all.

Playing the lead person in Before The Flood, Leonardo DiCaprio takes a different, and even unsuspecting role compared to his other films. Although he may not be a scientist or an expert in the field of climate change, he provides the bridge between experts and the common people in order to digest important information that many people just choose to tune out when they hear about it in their daily lives. However, other people have a different opinion, “Try to talk to anyone about climate change and people just tune out. They might have picked the wrong guy.” While DiCaprio says this, the montage that plays in the back and showcases Sean Hannity illustrates how certain people attack his credibility because he is “just an actor”. However, given the current state of the climate crisis, I think it is important as ever to harness the power and fame that many celebrities have in order to facilitate movements and cultural change to combat the climate crisis: especially given the fact that corporations and those interested in spreading false information about the climate crisis to fund their endeavors. When you have these big powerhouses that have billions of dollars at their disposal to attack these scientists and their work, it is necessary to have someone like DiCaprio spreading awareness on the situation.



</p><hr>


<p>
Before the flood resonated with me in a number of ways. Like DiCaprio, I also grew up in Los Angeles going to the same Natural History museum that inspired his passion for protecting our environment and advocation for climate change. DiCaprio cites how the museum was the one place in an urban empire like Los Angeles where one could truly appreciate the natural world and its history. Though the film brings up a number of important issues regarding the ever evolving climate crisis, beef, palm oil, pollution etc., I believe DiCaprio's love for the natural world that he gained as a child holds the most potential in relation to helping combat climate change. People who have a love for nature will be more inclined to take the measures needed to preserve it. DiCaprio is one of the most popular movie stars in the world, however, he is only one of the few "superstars" that are using their platform to discuss the glooming issue of climate change. This is because he was exposed to the beauty of nature as a child. Education needs to include more natural experiences for children in order for them to form a connection with nature that will encourage them protect it, especially in this distracting age of technology.

In the film “An Inconvenient Sequel” I found very eye opening facts laid out by Al Gore. I was surprised to find out that according to the film “ 14 of the 15 hottest years have occurred since 2001” and that says a lot about the dramatic temperature change. Sometimes hearing things, makes you think it’s bad, but sometimes seeing it makes you see truly how bad the situation is. Seeing the footage of the ice sheets of greenland melting  and hearing Dr. Steffen state that the elevation of the ice due to melting because of the temperature change was 12 meters from 2000 to 2016, that it is a very small period of time for the amount of change that cause to the ice elevation. The thing about the effects of climate change is that different parts of the world are going through it differently like Miami is struggling with the constant floods due to the sea level rising caused from the melted ice sheets. It is scary to think of all the power in the hands of a few that affects millions, such as the decision with the DSCOVR satellite which only did what was convenient for powerful industries  rather than the common good for the people. There seems to be a lot of struggles for change  since there are several obstacles the united states politics and lack of democracy according to Gore. Also the fact that less developed countries can not afford to use solar and wind power like perhaps more developed countries could. I think that the more developed countries should become a strong models for change throughs solar/ wind energy, which could then start building up support and could possibly help less developed countries in trying to adapt less polluting energy. I think the film did an excellent job showing the issues slowing the climate crisis down and trying to remedy that.

The film "Before the Flood" is a great example of celebrities taking action. Leonardo DiCaprio uses his platform and his huge following to educate people on what is happening to our planet right now. Many normal people would be much more inclined to believe in climate change and the climate crisis when they hear it coming out of the mouth of someone they revere and respect. This film also highlighted peoples' everyday actions and habits that contribute to the climate crisis. It shows the effects of the beef industry and many other agricultural practices that harm the environment. However, it gives me hope to see many leaders around the world speaking out for this issue and fighting for a better future. 
    <br><br>
Learning about how the scientist who release a graph of climate change trends life is being torn apart breaks my heart. He put his research forward to educate people and he receives death threats and has been vilified by politicians and political figures. However, I am not surprised to learn about the front groups and the fact that major political climate change deniers are funded by fossil fuel companies. They are being paid to rail against climate change as a hoax. Follow the money! It never lies.
    <br><br>
The United States needs to let go of their ridiculous ideals of “manifest destiny” and become a real world leader. If we are going to be a leader in producing emissions then we need to step up and be a leader in halting these emissions and moving towards renewable energy. Climate change denier Americans keep politicians from taking this stance and moving our country to lead the way it needs to. Small poor coastal regions are taking the bullet that the environment meant for the US. We are the root of this problem and we shouldn't be allowed to hide behind a curtain of money and privilege.

The film “Before the Flood” does a superior job at encasing the urgent and insidious issue we know as climate change. Something that stood out to me after watching this movie was that one of the major contributors to this global crisis is the public’s obliviousness to what’s happening around them—many simply just don’t know the severity of the issue. Not only is it already hard enough to catch the public’s attention, as the film explains, many faces of the media are spreading false information about the effects climate change has on the world. People, like those high up in fossil fuel industries, defend the U.S.’s extreme use of oil, coal, etc., because of their disregard for the future world. Movies like “Before the Flood” bring the public’s attention to the present and future effects of climate change, while also touching on the counter arguments blocking people from taking action against a serious issue.
       <br><br>
     This movie is not only effective at informing viewers about nationwide climate change, but also pushes viewers to take action themselves. Firstly, having a celebrity like Leonardo DiCaprio to star in the documentary—someone the public admires—brings a wider audience to the movie and pulls greater attention from that audience. Witnessing him take action and inform himself on climate change is inspiring for viewers: I know it was for me. 
        <br><br>
    The movies visuals were also powerful: the helicopter rides above man-made forest fires, melting ice sheets, floods, and other intense illustrations of the present effects of climate change depicting its seriousness. Also, seeing the communities who are struggling at the U.S’s expense emits a serious sense of guilt and push for all of us to do better.

In the documentary called “An Inconvenient Sequel”, it talks about the former Vice President Mr. Gore’s actions and efforts to improve the environmental issues. It suggests the main reason that causes the increasing numbers of hurricanes and floods in Florida is due to the melting of ice sheets and warming the ocean. It is heartbreaking to see the negative effects brought by those natural disasters and knowing the fact that people would have to endure those horrible environmental conditions due to climate change. The storms and the rising of sea level are reminding people to take actions to protect the planet and improve the environment conditions. If everyone on the planet shares the same goal, which is to decrease carbon emissions and face the truth of climate change, people will be able to make huge impacts on the planet and hopefully solve the problems. 
        <br><br>

The film also talks about renewable energy, which is very important to people’s daily life. A lot of resources that we are using now are limited, such as water, coal and fossil fuels. However, right now people are consuming fossil fuels at a rate that is far faster than fossil fuels can reproduce. If  we do not find the renewable energy to replace fossil fuels, there will be one day we have to accept the truth that the planet is running out of fossil fuels, and all the technologies which are powered by fossil fuels will be useless. Mr. Gore is able to use this film to raise awareness to the people around the world about the environmental crisis we are currently experiencing. The environment of the earth will affect everyone on the planet, so it is unnecessary to just consider the profits and influences for just one country, people should fight those issues as a whole.

Before the Flood” takes a great stance on climate change, that Leonardo DiCaprio was learning about all the consequences alongside the viewers instead of simply spitting out facts for the viewers. Though it is not so much positive on telling the viewers the story. But it is still making people understand and have the same feeling easily. It makes us realize that environmental problems should be solved together.  Though I used to feel strange at the beginning of this fil,. But later, I understand Leonardo Dicaprio’s strategy, he shows us the environmental crisis directly. Therefore, climate change and global warming are terrible and we are responsible for that. So changing some habits from ourselves and we can still protect the earth positively.

“Before the Flood” was a thought-provoking, yet alarming documentary. I’m very surprised that it didn’t get as much attraction as it should have since it calls attention to so many important red flags regarding the climate crisis. As other students have previously stated, it was quite interesting to see Leonardo DiCaprio spearhead the entire documentary. People including myself relatively perceived this in a way of a publicity stunt for Dicaprio and possibly his movies, but then realize himself and others like Al Gore are true advocates to changing the world and saving the planet. The content of the movie strives to find out ways to alleviate the problem of climate change in an interesting way, including how to prevent the rising sea level, investigating renewable energy, and immigration. It raises people’s awareness of the current environmental problem and appeals to people trying to advocate environmental protection. I can even say on a personal level the film's widespread journey and content inspire myself to do better and advocate for awareness about climate change as a whole.

At first I was a little hesitant in watching a 1 hour and 36 min film for a short response but since the film is on a topic I care about and its critically acclaimed I watched it. Firstly I must say it was brilliant and a must watch for all humans whether they believe in climate change or not. Secondly, it made me a lot more aware of the situation. During the film Leonardo Dicaprio talks to many influential people but one that really intrigued me was his conversation with Elon Musk. Together they discussed renewable energy and how the entire world could be powered by “100 gigafactories.” In order to build these there needs to be a lot of money and togetherness by all the countries. Renewable energy is the future and as soon as we get it perfect climate change will slow down drastically. A major point in the film is about how large corporations make huge profit margins but use the environment as their playpen. We all like money but there's a fine line in making bank and destroying the planet. This film plays a key role in our future and since there is a huge actor in it hopefully many people see it in order to learn about all what's possible.

Having seen the phenomenal movie Before the flood which takes its audience on a journey for knowledge about the climate crisis led by leonardo dicaprio, I was lucky enough to get to watch an inconvenient sequel. Because I had never seen an inconvenient truth which I knew to be so famous, loved and hated, it was good to finally see al gore's communication skills at work. Although he is not a climatologist, he is very knowledgeable about the wide range of environmental catastrophes that are taking place. Most namely, in the sequel he talks about the advent of more extreme weather events due to the warming of the planet. By doing this, Gore vindicates his claims in the first film he produced while simultaneously calling for more action to be taken to prevent future damage.
        <br><br>
In addition in inspiring a call to action, Gore also condemns president trump by criticizing his withdrawal from the Paris climate Accord. I appreciated that this was edited into the film after its original release to provide it audience with the most up to date information possible. This in turn enhanced its credibility and call to action by showing that under the current administration the US is heading nowhere near where it needs to be to prevent some of the worst effects of climate change. At this point, with hurricane harvey and other category five hurricanes that will soon come to be, it is apparent that humans have already triggered some harmful environmental events through greenhouse gas emissions. However, thanks to the work Gore and his team that put the movie together more and more people will start to see the problems we face and the urgency to solve them. Because of this I would recommend this film to anyone.

After watching the film “Before the flood”, I was surprised to find out that Leonardo DiCaprio had an involvement in climate change as the United Nations Messenger of Peace. He spent two years travelling around the world to inform us what the real issues are. We are shown the negative effects such as the ice melting and by 2040 people will be able to sail a boat where it was once ice sheets. We also see positive aspects such as Sweden becoming the first fossil fuel free country, hopefully with new innovations other countries will join and stop the burning of fuels. It’s sad to see that the United States is one of the countries who contributes most to the crisis yet don’t do much. I was saddened to see that the majority of Sumatra is intentionally place on fire to create palm oil, something that is found in our daily life and impossible to avoid.
        <br><br>
 I could also say that I learned some interesting facts, such as cows producing methane when they eat too quick and afterwards burp. I also found out that every molecule of methane is equal to 23 of carbon dioxide, which increases the effects. I had previously not heard about this film, since it probably didn’t get advertisement or exposure into the media. This is an educating video that should be seen worldwide so people become informed of what the world will become.  I also found it interesting how DiCaprio reference the mural in the beginning and end of the film, since it shows what the world will become if we don’t take care of it.

Leonardo DiCaprio’s film documentary, “Before the Flood” put the entirety of the climate crisis in perspective for me. I am not going to lie and say that I knew absolutely everything about climate change, because in reality, I was very ignorant about the subject. I was torn between those who first believed that the climate crisis was not real because they couldn’t physically see the repercussions, while also believing that it was so detrimental because its effects were not seen. What most people saw were the facts; pie charts, readings, and articles flooded this subject, but people did not actually believe its repercussions because they couldn’t see the direct impact on the environment. There is only so much science could do until it is too late; but with a film like “Before the Flood”, the state of the world is no longer up to graphs and formulas. It is the Artic’s generational glaciers melting, it is the Indonesian forest being destroyed by the wealthy, and it is the icy surface of Greenland turning completely black. It is the death of our planet as we know it, and if we do not do something soon, we will face the repercussions of our actions before we know it.
        <br><br>

The most eye-opening fact of this film was that there are so many solutions to his urgent issue, but no one is doing anything about it because of politics. We as a society rely so heavily on our political nature that it is literally destroying our planet simply because making money means more than doing what is right. Our greed will be the downfall of our planet, and we do not have time to continue sitting around and waiting for others to provide a solution when we have the means and the power to do so. For example, China’s choice to reduce their carbon footprint is a solution the United States could have instilled years ago (which could save years for the upcoming generation), but instead, they would rather sit in their wealth and dismiss their wrongdoings because it pays their bills. In China, where their people are allowed to firsthand track the violations their biggest companies act upon, could do it simply by searching it on their smartphone. Therefore, they can protest against the harm these factories have implemented upon their daily lives, and their carbon footprint will be reduced. The United States’ reason for not implementing a program like this is because: 1) half of the higher officials running our country think climate change is witchcraft 2) they cannot physically see it, so therefore it is not real (unlike China, who has the worst polluted air in the world) and 2) they just do not care enough. In the film, the Chinese official states the line, “you give people the data, you empower the people.” We, as Americans, already know what is going on behind the scenes, but if we were exposed to these same wrongdoings as the Chinese are, we would be in an entirely different state of life. Just by implementing an accessible resource like this, our carbon footprint could be reduced immensely. Protestors will no longer buy factory products, factories would have no money to run, and the 1% are finally held accountable. In one American home alone, their electricity consumed is equal to about 1.5 citizens in France, 2.2 in Japan, 10 in China, 34 in India, and an astonishing 61 in Nigeria. Although we are the most developed, we are the most harmful. The fact that we continue to build ‘bigger and better’ hold detrimental effects that we are not ready to see the repercussions of.
        <br><br>

The role of politics in climate change is the one setback stopping us from getting to the finish line. In the film, DiCaprio and the professor have a discussion about higher officials and how they are not actually elected leaders, but rather just elected followers. For example, they state how Obama once said that he does not support gay marriage (which was actually a surprise to me) becuase it would harm in the polls, but years later, he agreed that it should be legal becuase it would gain him more votes and support. “Once the people are convinced, the president will fall in line very quickly,” he states, and this statement is absolutely true. DiCaprio then goes on to meet with President Obama and brings up to him that if someone who doesn’t believe in climate change would take office in the future, that the dismantling of everything he worked for (such as the Paris Agreement) would be left in shambles. This was a chilling thing to hear because they predicted the future. With Trump in office, he not only believes that global warming is a hoax, but did as much as relieving the U.S. from the Paris Agreement because everything about the crisis is fake. It is incredibly infuriating that a person so inferior and close-minded is running one of the most developed countries in the world, and yet, it is the everyday people being bullied for the actions when they are people like him who have a carbon footprint a thousand times larger. Although the solution to saving the entire world is in arms reach, it all begins with politics– and if there is no change in the future of our office, we will say goodbye to everything we know simply because of ignorance.

The Film Before the Flood was a very interesting film. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a very intriguing view of climate change. I believe that having Leonardo DiCaprio in the film and narrating it was actually a good idea. People will hopefully be more likely to see the film and learn about the crisis that is currently going on.  Having someone like DiCaprio in the film will hopefully get people to listen to the crisis. The film gives the different view point surrounding climate change in terms of seeing this issue and how it affects the world. Not only does this film go over the denial of climate change being an issue but it also brings in a lot of different like aspects of scientists, the governments view point and even the Pope. As seen in the film climate change is happening and being seen across the world like the islands that are currently being flooded by the ocean.
        <br><br>
The film touches up on the fact the people feeling and seeing the climate change will not be places like the US but the nations and places who don't produces all this carbon footprint. These people are now being displaced from there home while they don't contribute to climate change. Seeing how much consumerism drives the need for fossil fuels and deforestation and the use of non renewable sources of energy is shocking. It really is not a surprise that the US is one of the top polluters and contributors to climate change. The whole Paris agreement part in the film was good to see in terms if seeing that people do care for the earth. Carbon Tax should be something that should be imposed on nations like the US in order to push for renewable sources of energy and to push for a better future because climate change is the real deal.

The film "Before the Flood" was very engaging and informative in educating the viewers of a large scope of issues regarding climate change. This film really brought to light that there are many issues that contribute to climate change, one of them being denial. Politicians in part have an influence on this denial, many politicians do not take the idea of climate change serious and therefore society does not view it as an urgency either. For example, the film discussed how Florida is more at risk due to the rising sea levels yet Rick Scott a politician from Florida refuses to even acknowledge climate change, and therefore continues to encourage this ignorance regarding the dangers climate change can entail. Our economy which is also dependent on fossil fuels plays a major role in climate change, these industries are more focused on income than helping make a change to improve our environment. These two factors alone, politicians and large industries, are big influencers on our society and if both continue to ignore the ongoing issues brought upon by climate change then our society will do the same. After watching this feel it definitely reassured me that small daily activities to help our environment can make a change, if all society collectively begins to make small changes eventually we will begin to see a difference and begin to attack the big problems at hand.

The usage of Leonardo DiCaprio in “Before the Flood” as the protagonist who wants to know the truth about the climate crisis was a well thought out and successful strategy to use. In this film, he  informs himself through traveling the world and by meeting lots of important, well informed individuals about the climate crisis. I believe this strategy really helped readers be able to get a clearer understanding of what climate change is and how important it is to take immediate action. Using a celebrity in the film, was a great way for Leonardo DiCaprio to use his platform to raise awareness on this topic, but also to grow the following documentary. By using him, more people who normally wouldn’t want to watch a documentary on this topic might be more inclined to do so. Also, it helps readers also embark on this hour and a half journey to get ideas of what immediate actions they can take part in their everyday lives to make a positive impact.
        <br><br>

"Before the Flood" presented me with numerous effects of climate change I did not know of. It also demonstrated how the climate crisis has currently impacted certain regions around the world and will continue to do so in the future and in other areas. Often times when we discuss these ideas, it is left out who will be impacted the most and who will be just fine for the most part. Poor impacted communities and regions around the world will see the greatest most devastating impacts, while wealthy countries like the U.S., who are also the largest polluters. I questioned my lifestyle of consumption while watching this entire film. I found myself constantly thinking of everything I do that is harmful. In the film’s section when it focused on Indonesia, I could not help feel bad about my contribution to companies profit off cheap commodities. Being informed how fires are purposely started to create palm oil plantations and how it is used in almost everything I buy, made me realize how little I actually pay attention to the problem. The products I buy have devastating impacts and it made me realize I need to change my lifestyle consumption and pay attention to little details. 
        <br><br>

I found this documentary to be very informative and engaging, no matter what specific impact of climate change was discussed, as a viewer, I couldn’t help but feel upset seeing we often leave out crucial details pushing them aside if they are not important when discussing climate change. It’s upsetting to see how politicians dismiss this issue and refuse to acknowledge or take action because they are funded by fossil fuel corporations. It was obnoxious and upsetting seeing politicians joke about such a serious topic. For example, the video of Trump joking about how it was cold and essentially there should be more global warming angered me. It does not help having leaders who joke like this and fuel other climate change deniers.  Having climate deniers being part of the government is truly saddening when there is evidence that proves them otherwise. I loved that the film exposes the corruptness of government and how in order for change to occur, we need to vote these leaders out of office.

When watching the film, "Before the Flood", I started to create a sense of connection and understanding with Leonardo DiCaprio when he admitted in the beginning to not knowing a lot about climate change compared to an actual scientist. Because I feel the exact same way, I want to help the environment, I want to help my planet, I do not want to be the problem anymore, but how if I all I knew before was carbon dioxide is bad and the temperature is rising? But as I watched this film, I soon realized that it is alright to not know the full picture of it all, as long as I understand it is my responsibility to accept the fact that climate change is real. As I was watching the film, I was horrified and disgusted when they began showing scenes of the Canadian Tar Sands and how the company Suncor Energy exploited all that land for cheap oil. It looked like a scene from a nightmare, but the sad part is, that nightmare is our reality and that scene is only a small snippet of the whole operation. We did this, it was not something that happened naturally, this was all human action and it is negatively affecting our planet.

        <br><br>

However, as I was watching the film, I was honestly surprised with how many people were denying the fact that climate change is real. It is just astonishing that people still want to deny credible studies that have been going on for many years just because "The planet is not actually warming up". It actually hurts my heart and mind to hear that when coming from a small farm town this is the truth. I remember the few years when Central California was heavily affected by the drought and how farmers and families were being affected by this. Even now, with the statement that the drought has ended, many of us are still being affected by the abnormally high and low temperatures. So much so that I remember that during the summer, the temperature within our small town spiked as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit. While in the winter, we have reached as low as 30 degrees Fahrenheit and I remember people freaking out when all the weather reports coming in saying we have a chance of actually receiving snow. Despite all of this and actually experiencing the hardships of the massive droughts and change in temperature, there are still people out there who do not believe that this climate crisis exists.

As a student in English 22 and now a student in English 23 I have had the opportunity to watch both the films “Before The Flood” and “An Inconvenient Sequel”. Both of the films are very educational and do a great job on informing the viewers about the climate crisis. Although they both serve a similar purpose, they each go about it a different way. In “Before The Flood” Leonardo DiCaprio is as desirous to learn about the climate crisis as the viewers are. This allows the viewer to learn and be educated along with Leonardo DiCaprio throughout his journey. In “An Inconvenient Sequel” Al Gore is more of a “certified” public figure in this topic of climate crisis. This allows for the film to lecture the viewers with someone of more experience and to show the viewers the struggles and activities of a huge climate crisis activist. 
        <br><br>

 Although each film has its own strengths due to utilizing different approaches, I would say “Before The Flood” is the superior one. Not to say that “An Inconvenient Sequel” is bad, but the approach in “Before The Flood” makes for a much more captivating and interesting film. Also, “Before The Flood” offers various solutions while “An Inconvenient Sequel” goes on and on about how renewable energy is a great solution, and well it is, but it is not the only one. From someone like Al Gore, who has been working on this issue for many years, I would expect a vast amount of solutions in a film that is attempting to fight against this huge issue of climate change. Despite this, Al Gore does a great job as an activist and as a messenger of the climate crisis, and this is seen throughout the film as he holds many trainings and also near the end of the film as he delivers a great and inspiring speech in which he compares this climate crisis movement to many other important movements that have occurred, such as the civil rights movement.

Following Leonardo Di’Caprio on his journey for climate justice is eye opening not only to the problems faced when trying to overcome climate change but is so visually educational on the effects of the change, from flooding cities and fields, to the oil choked rivers in Alaska and smog filled air of China. One can learn as much information on a subject as is possible. They can know every detail or possible outcome, but until they physically see the subject, its difficult to imagine the extremity of the situation. The little known facts like the snow in The Revenant being partially driven in or being filmed across the world for lack of snow demonstrate the extremity of changes in weather patterns. Interviews with individual in other countries emphasize the blame that gets thrown around and the unwillingness to accept blame or acknowledge that because one has made a mistake does not give you a pass to make the same mistake. The political schism of climate change denial and acceptance demonstrating in the movie is a strong incentive to be an active and informed voter for myself, as we need leaders who will create laws that can protect the future generations ability to experience the natural world. This film happens to relate to the films An Inconvenient Truth and An Inconvenient Sequel, as the narrator of those films was the first person to introduce Leonardo Di’Caprio to climate change. Overall an education film that should be shared and listened to.

After watching “Before The Flood”, I was confused about the significance of Leonardo DiCaprio as the main spokesperson or protagonist; he is a world-renowned and good looking actor who has a reputation for dating women half his age, takes jets to travel which increases his carbon footprint and is a vegan. I had never seen him as an environmentalist, or a model figure for the environment, unlike people today (Greta Thunberg, a sixteen-year-old environmental activist). But then again, the film illuminated on that aspect of DiCaprio’s career; since he is an actor, the public would not take his words and motivation seriously in combating climate change. He, like Thunberg, experienced backlash for being a key voice in this movement. 
        <br><br>
 Anyways, I believed the film was well executed in that it projected climate change is not just America's problem, but also other countries that live and need to adapt to the effects such as China with the pollution and smog-- people in China usually wear masks because the air is contaminated. We, as very privileged Americans, don’t get to realize these terrible conditions of other poorer parts of the world; our high carbon footprint affects the other side of the world such as Africa or India. In a way, this film would be effective for an audience who do not know a lot about climate change but want to learn more. It can be a great introductory film because it features a lot of familiar faces such as the Pope, President Obama, and even Elon Musk. These faces also bring up excellent points such as Musk explaining about his sustaining company and factory as well as the Pope acknowledging that the Paris Agreement is a step but more should be taken to further combat climate change.

In the film "Before the Flood", climate change was seen through a first hand basis through multiple countries and by the people who are currently suffering its impacts. Here Leonardo DiCaprio is our lens for insight on the truth behind the climate crisis and the actions that are being done in order to help aid our Earth.Using DiCaprio, in my opinion, was an interesting choice because he points out that he does not have the credentials to be appointed to a title such as the UN Peace Messenger, but he allows the viewer to relate to the presented base line knowledge that he expresses on climate change. Most of us do not realize the severity of climate change and how different parts of the world view the United States in terms of their leadership in this epidemic. Often times we believe we have the  right to speak out to developing countries and comment on their means on doing so without taking into consideration the process we took in order to progress as a nation. DiCaprio was a perfect example of this when speaking on the actions India can undergo in order to help reduce their carbon footprint. He demonstrates that often times we point our fingers towards other people who are considered disadvantaged in terms of their resources in order to help clean up the mess we made. In stead of looking towards the ways others who do not have access to readily available resources for change, we should look within our own consumption and lifestyle and lead by example. In the film it was mentioned that the amount of energy used for one person from the United States is equivalent to that of 34 people from India. 
        <br><br>


In this film my eyes opened on the amount of change that is going around the world and the lack of urgency we possess. It is mentioned that even switching our consumption of beef to chicken will help with the amount of methane that is being released in the atmosphere and the amount of land that is being used for our life stock. We often put our own luxuries over the bare needs for other humans and animals to survive. We do not take into consideration other organisms that do not have the same privilege as we do. 
        <br><br>


I though it was powerful when the Pope reached out and blended science and religion in order to create a sense of urgency within the people. He prays that the poor will be able to survive because they been given the short end of the stick . It is not fair that they must pay the cost created by more developed countries. We have seen the issue at hand, but the question is will we step up and take action.

“An Inconvenient Truth” is the first environmental documentary led by a politician I have seen and it definitely displays the political feature. You study environment then you know Al Gore. The used to be Mr. Vice President has his name known for being an out and out environmentalist. The film records some of his world tour training on climate change and how he deals with international environmental issues on a regular basis. For 20 years he has dedicated himself into climate movement, and it is fairly touching to see someone actually builds his whole schedule around such work. What most shocks and moves me is the footage ice glaciers nonstop cracks into the water. I could not imagine how to just be right there with the huge ice sheets disappearing in seconds with only the footage being so breathtaking. During his speeches, Al Gore shows an anger and passion that simply must not be fake. However, negotiating with underdeveloped countries like India, Al Gore as a recovering politician, seems to have so few to argue on improving environment. The US has not done enough to be in a leader role in fighting climate change and hold little excuse to accuse or request any other world country to do anything.
        <br><br>
“Before The Flood” is obviously well-made in professional manners. The overall structure and organization are clear and effective in conducting its subject but in the sense of context, it offers nothing new. It is interesting that Leonardo Dicaprio is leading the film. Criticism may arise for an actor that is supposed to be shallow and uneducated in science to make such an informative documentary film, while no one can deny that merely the appearance of the name of Leonardo on the cast list would bring a considerable many more of people to watch the film and luckily to be concerned in the problem after.
        <br><br>
My feelings were mixed when I was watching the film. In the first expeditions Leonardo made, I saw only destruction and desperation. People and animals who have done least to cause climate change suffer most from it. People are losing homes and animals are losing habitats. So far I hold deeply pessimistic ideas towards the problem whereas when Leonardo came to a fancy factory of Elon Musk’s, a solution was given. It turns out that 100 of these power factories could provide the whole planet sufficient renewable energy. Only a hundred. Compared to all the destruction we’ve made and the ongoing ones, a hundred seems like the least we can do. However, a disturbing fact is that current political situation and social trends are simply not letting it happen.



</p><hr>


<p>
At the beginning of the movie “ Before the Flood”，Leonardo introduced “The Garden of Earthly Delights”, a painting he would stare at it every night when he was a kid. There are three separate panels in the painting which is in fact corresponds with the three stages we are experiencing. The first panel has a scene full of energy and hopefulness and depicted the world at the beginning of its creation with Adam and Eve, the first generation of human beings. As for the second scenario, it starts to involve the infusion of deadly sins and overpopulation. A stage that we are now facing. Finally, for the last panel, the situation gets even worse, which is claimed as nightmarish via Leonardo since the landscape is degraded and destroyed. A possible situation we may well face in the future if we refuse to take appropriate measures to enhance the climate change.
        <br><br>

In the first half of the film, it exposes the reason for taking no account of the global warming. Today, global warming is a hot topic to discuss which leaves us a misleading perception that we are already familiar enough with the consequence brought by global warming. Nevertheless, most of us are totally unaware of the seriousness of the issue itself and even skeptical about the existence of global warming. And the global giants of organic fuel companies are the major to blame for since they impend the ordinary to gain enough effective information about the global warming since they rely on fossil fuels, the major culprit of the emission of CO2, to make money. Once people realize the real consequence brought by global warming, they will reduce and even cease to use the fossil fuel, an act which may well cut the road for those fossil fuel companies to make money. Thus, they have to ally with governments, which devotes only on improving the economy, to create the false data to mislead the public to refuse the global warming theories put up by scientists who take decades to collect the data to prove the existence of it. Due to the greed, the governments and the companies utilize the skepticism as their psychological manipulation to control the people's cognitive tool.
        <br><br>

Then, after introducing the dangerous consequences brought by the climate change, the movie begins to raise several appropriate measures for us to take to mitigate the emission of CO2. For instance, using chicken rather than beef as protein to take since the cow accounts for large portion of emission of C02. And the most predominant thing about the movie is that we should be optimistic and have faith in humanity. We should believe that once we start taking measures that are devoting on reducing the emission of C02, we can be far away from those horrible warning consequences

Before the flood was an interesting movie about the climate crisis. I was very interested on what Leonardo DiCaprio would learn about the climate and if we would be able to figure out some solutions to this growing problem. Initially I questioned why Leonardo was chosen to be a messenger of peace on climate change because I formally know him as just a Hollywood actor. After watching the film I learned that he is very interested and has been an advocate for solving the climate change issue for some time now. I also learned that most of our economy is based on fossil fuels and that there are people with fossil fuel interests who are promoting the denial of climate change to protect their wealth. Multiple politicians shown in the movie were said to have been bought out so that they could publicly deny the affects of burning fossil fuels. Although the movie provides some solutions to climate change including investigating renewable energy, watching it was very tough for me because it made me feel helpless specifically when it showed that politicians are being paid to deny climate change.

I watched Before the Flood and really enjoyed the way that the film was made. Although I think (or would at least hope) that many people would watch the film solely because of the informative and eye opening environmental documentation, I know that some documentaries, though illuminating,can be a bit drab, and having a celebrity like Leonardo DiCaprio does make the movie more appealing. I think that he did a very good job relating to the audience, always asking questions during interviews as though he was just learning these things for himself for the first time. I was actually surprised to have this aspect pointed out in this youtube video because I never would have thought that he was asking many questions rhetorically. It ended up having the intended effect on me! I think that this stylistic choice made the film and topic much more approachable to a viewer who may not have prior knowledge on the topic. I think that the culmination of DiCaprio’s clear passion about the topic, his voiceover narration, and the, at times, dramatic soundtrack, in addition to the importance of the people who DiCaprio interviewed, definitely stressed the importance of the topic, and put the viewer in a position where he/she can feel the gravity of the situation. I unquestionably believe that this film created the messages, provided the information, and donated the feelings in which it intended to. Now I think the only issue is how to get climate change skeptics to sit down and watch it.

Prior to watching “Before the Flood” I never thought about or realized how bad the climate crisis we are facing is. I knew it was happening but never made an effort to fully grasp what was happening around the world. This film opened my eyes to how big the danger of climate change really is. There are scientists that are providing facts about the changes and there are people in the world who truly believe that climate change is just a hoax. It's incredible to me how people don’t understand or realize that our planet is suffering due to our activities and negligence to comprehend the effect that we have on the environment. 
        <br><br>

Before watching this I didn’t know that Leonardo DiCaprio was an environmentalist. It originally shocked me that he would be the one talking about the climate crisis in this film because I thought he was just an actor so what did he really know about the climate. But that was the point, he was going around learning more about the crisis as the viewers were learning and becoming more aware of the direction our planet was going and proposed solutions. DiCaprio is using the platform that he has created for himself for a greater good and it shows the things that celebrities could do with how much power and influence they have on society.

I liked the Before the Flood film. DiCaprio is bringing awareness to climate change and contributing to the discourse. In class, we learned that plant-based diets would help slow down the impact of climate change. I think it is great that there are things people can do to help at the individualistic level. There is an article from the Guardian that reported "100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988" and I can only hope that we pay attention to that study. 

        <br><br>

Overall, this film was great for the cause. I think it helps having DiCaprio being the face of the film. He is a household name in this country and he can definitely attract new people to join and help fight climate change.

After watching the film “Before the Flood,” I’ve realized that every resource that every country, no matter poor or rich country, provides or harms plays major contributors to the cause of climate change. It’s essential that the leaders of every country are aware of what they should do. In this film, DiCaprio developed a strong argument and persuasive issue to convince well-known leaders to enforce doable environmental strategies to the world and face the real problem. “We don’t have clean fossil fuels.” This statement brought me to think about how people consume fossil fuels so greatly and uncontrollably. To be honest, in real life, I don’t have any idea of how much fossil fuel or other energy I have consumed in a day. Therefore, I believe a large amount of people will be exactly like me. In addition, the film mentions that 47 percent of land in the US is food production, and of 70 percent of the land is to feed cattles. This statistic unexpectedly shocks me. Since people have to absorb a certain amount of proteins every day, we enjoy having beef and chicken for our meals. Nevertheless, as beef is being produced, it produces methane that will awfully hurt the atmosphere of our world, in which is far more impactful than CO2 (carbon dioxide). As a result, “Before the Flood” teaches me new and useful environmental knowledge that makes us want to actually put more attention to our painful planet.

Within the film Before the Flood, I was immediately interested in the role that DiCaprio assumes for the audience. Opening and closing with the Before the Flood imagery, a heavy emphasis is placed on exploring the course of the documentary, alongside DiCaprio within the film. Initially I was interested in the comment that 'if this boat is sinking, we'll all have to sink together" by Ban Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary General that opens up and introduces DiCaprio as a UN appointed messenger of peace. This is then contrasted with the articles and news outlets attacking him as an individual who is not scientifically trained to address/speak on behalf of the problems at hand. The questions arising from him are explored by the viewer throughout the footage, which comes to include interviews and footage of the current destruction. In conversation with Sunita Narain, questions arise as to the US' global impact and scale of CO2 and other emissions. What's often overlooked from people I've spoke with is how everyday situations and choices have a large impact on what is felt worldwide. The documentary goes onto explore countries such as China and Indonesia of which are both key areas. Visiting by country/location, DiCaprio visits areas that are trying to commit to a sustainable future and/or have been wrecked havoc by the emissions of fossil fuels. He also goes onto include that while an environmental issue first and foremost, it is also a political one (as can be seen now in AUS). By including former US Secretary of State Kerry, documentation of the Paris Climate Accords, the impact of worldwide adoption is very well necessary. Compared to current times, the 'pulling out' done by the Trump Administration of the Paris Climate Accords is detrimental when done by a nation contributing as high a number of emissions worldwide. Dispute over Climate Change as human caused largely has to do with not adequate enough education, while also a sense of denial as well, as seen by corporations, interest groups, and politicians. This film took a largely call to action stance in my eyes, as not only DiCaprio, but what I got from viewing it myself, as to get involved, put pressure on those in power and make choices that can have great effect, but above all, educate individuals. As mentioned in class, one of the biggest factors is our reliance and support as consumers on dietary choices that can be changed.

Before The Flood raises many good questions about how we, as a human race collectively, should approach climate change. Climate change as a global issue is known for decades but it seems that we are losing this race against climate change. There are simple things that we can do to help mitigate climate change as we know better and better about where all these carbon dioxide and methane are coming from. As stated in the video, if we just half our consumption of beef, we could reduce the methane emission (consequently the total greenhouse gas emission) by a considerable fraction. This is a very plausible measure to take since it seems very doable. But many other sources of carbon emissions are not so easy to deal with. We can see that climate change is somewhat a byproduct of a couple hundred years of technological development by looking at the current China. Chinese economy has boomed since the end of the 20th century, and fossil fuel is a large part of the energy sources. However as a result of such rapid growth, the pollution got more and more severe in large cities and many people’s lives were negatively affected. If it weren’t for those serious cases of pollution, I believe people wouldn’t have taken it very seriously. Many other developing countries like India desire the lifestyle that Americans have and of course as we see in China that making such advancement in technology would potentially make climate change worse. It seems that there is a cost for such an economic development, and without this development they can hardly do anything to help lower the risk of coming to that tipping point. This dilemma is something that definitely needs to be addressed. But of course there are always some little steps that we can take and it can be a good point to start.

Before the Flood, in my opinion, was an incredibly moving documentary. I am a huge Leonardo DiCaprio fan and I believe his earnesty and humbleness throughout the film really resonates with the viewer. It took me back to The Uninhabitable Earth reading where Wallace-Wells refers to the fact that global warming is not a major subject in fiction because it doesn’t follow the story of an individual conscience or protagonist. Before the Flood directly addresses this by following the journey of Leo’s own discovery of what climate change really meant for the entire world. By traveling around the world and meeting underprivileged communities, the documentary utilizes pathos and allows for those struggling to be seen and heard. It was especially saddening to see the flooding of the entire field of crops in India that many hardworking people rely on in the community. 
        <br><br>

Leo makes a great protagonist because he’s a renowned, incredibly liked actor, but managed to show a vulnerability that we all experience when it comes to understanding the climate crisis. On top of that, he uses his position and agency to also interview world leaders and experts to further validate his credibility on the issue. It was really enlightening to see the wide variety of people featured in this film too, which gives the viewer a lot more hope about the future by getting a glimpse of the people leading us towards a sustainable future and more solutions that everyday people can do or encourage our leaders to do. For example, seeing how an economic professor advocates for a carbon tax, how a scientist advocates for less beef, and how entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are investing in a sustainable future, makes me hopeful rather than making me numb towards the issue. It gives me a sense of empowerment to make the changes in my own life. This film was greatly successful in targeting and engaging with an audience that may not typically care and have knowledge about the climate crisis.

In the world's current political climate of fake news and misinformation the film "Before the Flood," emphasizes one of the biggest threats to the our planet and world today. Unlike one would think, the solving the climate crisis itself is not only one of our biggest issues at hand. If you follow any politics around the world, it is evident that one of our biggest threats to democracy and other issues is the creation of fake news and misinformation by individuals and certain groups who have a goal to push a certain agenda. This threat applies to the climate crisis directly as seen in the film "Before the Flood." The film depicts the struggle of bringing light and acknowledgment of the the real crisis at hand through the main character Leonardo Di Caprio. Despite the fact the crisis is evidently true, he finds himself at war with an organized misinformation campaign designed to misinform the world on the real crisis of climate change. These individuals leading the push for misinformation and fake news are pushed by their self interests and believe it is in their best interest to stop the knowledge of the severity of the crisis from getting out. This is undoubtedly the first obstacle of tackling the climate crisis, and will undoubtedly be the toughest obstacle to overcome with our current political and media situation. The film as well does a great job of how the rest of the world will truly be effected, because it is easy to feel not that terrified when looking at nations like the US, that seem to not change at all. This film brings to light the main reason any real climate crisis prevention is being progressed and what the real consequences of the crisis truly are and ultimately could be.

Having watched both The Inconvenient Truth and An Inconvenient Sequel many times, I appreciate the straightforward and impactful nature that Al Gore aims to achieve with the format of the films. For me personally, they have been some of the most motivating films in regard to my relation to the climate crisis. I especially like how the 10 year gap between the films depicts the progression of the climate issue, particularly the flooding of the world trade center memorial. Additionally, it was interesting to see, through An Inconvenient Sequel, what it took for negotiations to continue and an agreement to be reached at the 21st COP-UNFCCC, from a different perspective.



</p><hr>


<p>
I think this movie should be on everyone's "must watch" list. 
        <br><br>
First, because it encompasses so many aspects of the climate crisis, and it does it in a very engaging way. For example, all of the locations that Leo has visited had illustrated the causes of this issue that keep affecting so many people around the world. These people, who contributed to this crucial problem so little, are suffering the most from it. It is sad to see how their previous lives were destroyed because of the actions of negligent others who do not have any consequences for their work. 
        <br><br>
Second, because it also takes a look at the political side of the problem. In the film, there were various clips shown of different people in the government who have been getting "bonuses" thanks to their sponsorship with powerful oil and gas companies. This explains why some of the government officials reacted so passionately (in a negative way) to climate crisis activists and even the whole idea of climate change. Unfortunately, due to the greediness of others, the innocent have to suffer again, and it doesn't look like, at least in the near future, that anything is going to change. For instance, the US pulling out of the Paris Agreement in 2017 proves that most are not looking in the desirable direction. 
        <br><br>
Third, because it provides solutions. Many of us are aware of the problem, but we are just not sure what we should do. This film focuses on many aspects of climate change contribution from many points of views: from reasoning the raises in taxes to explaining the bonuses to switching the diet by one component.

<p>
In the film, Leonardo and his team went to many different places in the world to discuss about the climate changes and told the audience about the environmental problems. With the global demand of fossil fuels, the oil company are faced extremely problem to make sure their demand in Canada. Gas is a basic thing in modern life which people use gas in everywhere, such as factories, machines, and cars. People need a huge amount of gas to support their daily life. There are some other way to solve the problem of fossil fuels. People could take public transportation in their daily life to reduce using gas. The other serious problem is that the rapid melting of ice causes climate change, and it do not only affect the Arctic but also damage people who do not live in the Arctic. The climate change have a negative influence on people’s daily life. So, government could make laws to regulate less cars and factory pollution.  With this efforts, the environment would be better in the future.

Film: Before the Flood 
        <br><br>
I believe this film gives us a more comprehensive understanding of the enormous damage that human activity is doing to our planet. Leonardo DiCaprio spent two years traveling to various parts of the world includes the Pacific islands, India, Alaska, China. The first-hand information and interviews presented to the audience by the film effectively introduce the climate crisis to the audience and draw people’s attention. I was most impressed by his interview with Piers Sellers, the Director of the Earth Science Division at NASA. He had been diagnosed with cancer, but he still wanted to use the time he had left to contribute to our planet. According to NASA, if no effective actions are taken, extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, extreme heat, extreme cold and so on will become more frequent and intense. However, Sellers still holds a positive and optimistic attitude. He said as long as more people get informed about climate change and are willing to take action, we planet could still be saved. Even though I don’t have the next generation yet, I don’t want to leave an environment of suffering to our children. I believe we have the ability to fix this issue and recover our planet and give our children an environment to live in.

The documentary Before the Flood was a great informative way to broadcast the effects of climate change. There is a lot of evidence showing climate change and humans are the main problem. Essentially everything we do contributes to climate change. Building cities, modes of transportation, even the food we grow/eat. This is not only terrifying, but very eye opening. It’s clear that we are the only thing that can fix this issue, and we should start doing everything that we can to prevent our downfall. The video made me wonder what can I do, that I am not already doing will  help reduce my carbon footprint. I had already known that becoming vegan is better for the planet, but I didn’t know to what extent. After watching the film I can see one of the main ways I can help is by eating less meat. I am going to begin to try to eat less by slowly cutting down, and then hopefully eliminate it all together eventually. Before watching the film, I wasn’t aware of Leonardo DiCaprio’s involvement regarding climate change. I enjoyed learning about his efforts and gained a great deal of respect for him. I think more celebrities with their platforms should be doing more to raise awareness like DiCaprio. However, I know his interests have caused some backlash from others, so I wonder if that is why many of them choose to stay out of matters like this. I liked how the video shows people in their day to day lives and how climate change has affected them because ultimately I think it is easy to forget about the issue when you don’t experience the consequences first hand. Other than the fires we have had, I don’t think many people in California have been affected. Overall the documentary was really great and I think more people should take the time to watch it. I sent it out to some family members who don't believe in climate change.

It’s not unusual to see celebrities and politicians talking about the environmental crisis, but not every single person among these people is actually doing something. Comparing to those celebrities who are doing nothing except giving out speeches with big words, what Leonardo DiCaprio did is very outstanding. DiCaprio traveled to those countries with environmental issues, which is rare and brave for an influential person. I think the major issue for the world to deal with is that the developing countries may have to damage their environment in order to be productive and develop while those developed countries are proposing protecting our planet and even blame on the necessary development of those developing countries. The environmental crisis is a complicated issue to deal with because the causes of it can be traced back to the industrial age, the time when today’s developed countries started their development. For this reason, it’s very unfair to make today’s developing countries take all the criticisms and responsibilities. 
        <br><br>
I know there are many people say that they don't really care about the environment and they don't even believe what the scientists have said because their daily life has not gotten affected yet. Thus, there should be a way to "educate" and convince them. In my opinion, DiCaprio is the right person doing this because of his fame and world-wide influence. By letting a famous person like him showing the issue to the public, I believe there would be more people start to care about the environmental crisis and learn more about the issues.

The film “Before the Flood” follows actor and Leonardo Dicaprio through his journey of finding out more about the climate crisis through the lens of his new role as a Messenger of Peace. Dicaprio’s somewhat childlike curiosity takes him to a number of different places around the globe to see if there is a way to recover the damage already done or if the planet will inevitably look like the nightmarish third panel of Hieronymus Bosch’s, “The Garden of Earthly Delights”.
        <br><br>

 Although it may seem that Dicaprio is nieve in a sense when looking at his reactions in most parts of the film, I certainly felt the same way when directly looking at the icebergs melting, the burning forests, the displaced animals, and many more atrocities caused by the climate crisis. Dicaprio’s interactions with the actual natives living in places that have already been tremendously affected by global warming really put into scope for me how devastating the results of fracking, producing palm oil, and livestock really is. Thankfully throughout the film, the viewer is given tips on how to reduce their carbon footprint.
        <br><br>

 This film also brought the political side of the climate crisis to the forefront. Climate change is fueled by money-hungry politicians and leaders who profit off of the fossil fuel industry. They couldn’t care less about the climate when they are getting paid millions of dollars to dismiss the fact that climate change is real and the solution is in their hands, but they can’t pass any legislation on improving it. Dr. Sunita Narain brings drives home the message that the US needs to claim responsibility for what they’ve contributed to the crisis and lead the rest of the world in changing things for the better before it’s too late.
        <br><br>

 This film did a wonderful job of showcasing the effects of climate change, and made the viewer really understand that this is not a problem that is elsewhere in the world, but outside the viewers' very own front door. Dicaprio further emphasized that although humans aren’t feeling that much of an effect, much of the wildlife has been and will continue to feel the effects of climate change. Even though this film won’t convert any climate change deniers, it definitely gives the believers fuel to fight even stronger against those who continue to dismiss climate change.

The Film "Before the Flood", allowed me to understand the climate crisis more in depth. As Leonardo DiCaprio visited many places around the world, it was very interesting to see what the release of the greenhouse gases are causing in various locations. It was also very interesting to hear the opinion of many representatives from other countries.  Narain, the representative of India, in the film mentioned that we Americans are the ones causing major damage, "putting a hole in the Earth", and yet the countries that are causing the least are the ones taking action. She also mentions the claim, that the poor are the ones who will suffer from the damage being made by the wealthy but yet, they will also only be able to withstand the consequences for so long. She made it very clear that there will not be major changes until we Americans join in on making a difference. 

        <br><br>

It was very surprising to see how many people are in denial of climate change. disappointingly,  many of those people are those who hold the power to start making a difference. The film showed many comments about those who are in denial but what stood out to me the most is that the chair of the senate environment committee wrote a book about climate change being "The Greatest Hoax". It is rather upsetting that people could be arrogant. Besides the senate being ran by "fossil fuel climate change deniers" , people that are in denial can go to certain extremes as to sending threats. Dr. Mann's experience after publishing the cooling and warming trend was very interesting. I think this shows the effect politicians have on the issue and shows the major trend of denial. Besides those with power fighting against stopping climate change, there are many others in the film who show that they are optimistic about being able to fix the issue and that is quite comforting. After watching the film  I have realized that although "the ice is melting, earth is warming, and sea levels are rising" that there are realistic ways in which we can stop it. There are many possibilities to repair!

The film "Before the Flood" is a great example of celebrities taking action. Leonardo DiCaprio uses his platform and his huge following to educate people on what is happening to our planet right now. Many normal people would be much more inclined to believe in climate change and the climate crisis when they hear it coming out of the mouth of someone they revere and respect. This film also highlighted peoples' every day actions and habits that contribute to the climate crisis. It shows the affects of the beef industry and many other agricultural practices that harm the environment. However, it gives me hope to see many leaders around the world speakin gout for this issue and fighting for a better future.

“Before the Flood” is able to take the viewer on a trip exploring climate change alongside Leonardo Dicaprio. The movie provides breadth on the issue, discussing many causes and effects of environmental change as well as ways to personally change. The movie helps show how easy it is to make a difference, giving examples of change such as cutting out red meat.
        <br><br>
In a similar way to how the article from this week opened up my eyes to the true effects of our pollution, “Before the Flood” opened my eyes to the mass ignorance of our actions. The movie laid out the truths of what might happen to our planet due to our actions, but then goes beyond that to illustrate the lack of awareness that we share as Americans. Dicaprio's exploration of climate change denial shows how just how unjust the climate change issue can be. A lack of acknowledgement that the problem even exists leads to an exacerbation of the problem. Dicaprio and the movie do a good job of trying to expose this lack of acknowledgment, due both to societal ignorance and political manipulation

<p>
The title of this film and the background behind it really intrigued me as it was inspired by this painting that would be above his crib. A painting he had so much familiarity with as he stared at it for various years. I like how he is able to connect it to his work in the film. He uses the art done to make a statement and support his argument. According to Leonardo Dicaprio we are in the second panel, “HumanKind Before The Flood.” We are abusing from Earth and the resources that she provides us with. He is scared of the last panel becoming a reality. That Earth will become this dark wasted place due to mankind not taking care of her when we had the chance.
        <br><br>

 It amazes me the dedication and passion he has for this issue. Him going to all these countries that greatly impacted by climate change trying to gain a greater understanding of how these countries are contributing or being affected by this crisis just makes me admire him more. I have heard about him speaking upon this topic previously but after watching this film I was able to get a better view of it. I was also able to get a view of all the trouble behind this crisis. Its infuriating to see people who have the power to help or do something about it chose not to do something over greed. Their wealth prevents them from experiencing the unhealthy air, no power energy or going hungry. While those who are less unfortunate experience it first hand.

<p>
"Before the Flood" opened my eyes to a whole new perspective on climate change. It really exposed unfiltered realities of changes our earth is enduring. One thing that specifically stuck out to me was the melting of the blue ice. Not only was there an unimaginable amount of solid ice that melted, but it all happened in a time span which should've been impossible. There is no possible way that someone can watch this film and still believe that climate change is either a lie, or that it isn't as extreme as we are told. This film portrays a lack of hope at this rate. If we don't take productive action now, our earth will not survive. How much longer does this need to go on in order for people to finally come to the realization that our earth needs our help and it needs our help ASAP. I must also say that I appreciate how involved Leonardo DiCaprio is in trying to educate others on this matter.

“ Do you really know about the truth of climate change?” That is something I asked myself, after watching the movie Before Flood. Before watching the film, I felt like climate change is just a simple topic and there are really easy ways for us to protect the environment. However, my perspective suddenly changed when I saw the suprising facts that happened in Greenland, India, China etc. I felt disappointed when I heard about the snow melting at a surprisingly high speed in Greenland; realized the complexity of this environmental issue when I saw it is impossible to change the situation in India within one day or two. I felt exactly the same depressed as the characters in the film when I found it is too hard to alter the life, the surrounding environment 
         <br><br>

Another interesting thing I noticed in this film is that, as a powerful and developed nation, the United States actually has not achieved the goal to become eco-friendly. Maybe due to the large demand for elasticity to supply the sustainment or operation of factories, maybe just for home use. But shouldn’t the developed countries make more sound commitment to the world or at least follow the code of conduct to save energy? 
         <br><br>

Hopefully, the film also proposed several ways for us to protect the environment. We should realize that even just a small step could beciome a large contribution to the whole world.! So why don’t we become optimistic about our future and just start right now.

Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Sequel” was very inspiring, in this film, he is seeking a balance in between the needs of developed and developing countries, due to the fact that “the gravest effects of all attacks on the environment are suffered by the poorest,” developed countries are the ones that should stand out and play a role to reduce climate change. As for “Before the Flood”, I think this film did a good job expressing the most important issue we have right now which is climate change. By traveling with Leonardo DiCaprio, I have a clear view of those terrible impacts of climate change brought to the environment around the world, and a sense of urgency that we need to do anything to save the planet. So many devastating problems have occurred due to climate change: ice field melting, sea level rising, natural disasters and bad weathers are becoming more and more frequent. One of the examples shown in the film that how Greenland’s melting ice is causing a change of color, then no longer reflects the sun but absorbs it and creates heat is very impressive to me. shown in the the film also comes up with some solutions such as developing wind and solar power and considering carbon tax to reduce the burning of fossil fuels, as well as eating less beef. We should all put in actions before the flood.

The documentary film “ Before the Flood” was definitely an eye opener. It made me sad to see how much damage we have caused to the planet in such a short period of time but it also angered me. It angered me to see and hear that many people believe that climate change is a hoax largely due to the actions of politicians. Many discredit the findings of scientists and divide the public by telling them climate change is not real when in fact there is evidence to back it up. It is the job of the media and our country’s leaders to inform us of the events going on. However they aren’t showing us the whole picture and in fact feeding us false information on these issues largely because it would hurt their pockets. If the public as a whole knew about the harmful side effects of many of the everyday products and things they bought, they would stop buying them causing large companies to lose their money. Many countries have taken action to fight global warming but it is still not enough. Creating a sustainable environment isn’t intangible, but as Sunita Narain stated in her interview with Leonardo Dicaprio dominating countries such as the U.S. need to show their leadership by changing their ways and switching over to renewable energy, and soon the rest of the world will follow.

I found the documentary “Before the Flood” to be a very impactful and interesting film. I felt that Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job at fully showing the effects of climate change. It is really great seeing celebrities use their money and influences in order to make a change in the world, especially considering we have people in Congress with money and more power that do not lift a finger in regards to climate change. It feels like more celebrities are doing more to raise money and spread awareness for climate change than our politicians. We see celebrities such as Lil Dicky making music like his song “Earth” (which features multiple celebrities) to raise money for various environmental organizations, or YouTubers such as Mr.Beast who planted 20 million trees. Therefore I support anyone who is using their money and fame to create a change in the world. 
         <br><br>

One statistic that really shocked me the most about the film was that although 97% of scientists agree climate change is real, there are 131 climate deniers in congress and 38 climate deniers in the senate. It’s very heartbreaking to see that the United States politicians are prioritizing money over the lives of trillions, especially since the U.S. is the world’s #2 polluter. As the Indian environmentalist Sunita Narain says “The U.S. is a fossil addicted country.” The film does a good job at stressing that as one of the world's leading nations, the U.S has to lead in order to create change. Although Leonardo DiCaprio is not a scientist, I feel that he is still very well-educated on the topic and really shows the viewer how real people are being impacted because of climate change. Sometimes living in a “first world” country, we forget about our own carbon footprint and forget how the less fortunate countries are suffering. The film is very eye-opening to how our actions in the United States affect other countries.

The Fossil Fuel Industry does a very similar strategy as did other corporations did to make the science into a debate rather than pure facts. It can go back to the 1950s where the Tobacco Industry paid people to convince the public that there was not enough science to prove that smoking cigarettes caused cancer. The scientific industry had a long struggle to get the Federal Government to require that the Tobacco Industry require to add a warning on their products that it caused cancer. Climate scientists are currently fighting a similar struggle in trying to convince the public that climate change is, in fact, real and is caused by humans. This issue has been turned into a public debate on "opinions" instead of it just being science. Due to this, Climate Change has started to take a toll on the world as shown in the film, "Before the Flood," such as cities such as Miami, FL projected to be fully underwater because of the rising temperatures. It is a scary reality that we are entering because of the devastating impacts excess greenhouse emissions will have on our planet: rising sea levels, more frequent and dangerous weather patterns, and the destruction of habitats. It is sad that climate change will hit those in less developed countries compared to those in more developed nations although they are the ones least contributing to this issue. Though, there is still hope because of movements such as the Sun Rise, Greta Thunberg and the #FridaysforFutures and even people like Leonardo DiCaprio are doing everything they can to stop climate change from progressing any further.

The film Before the Flood was interesting in that it emphasized Leonardo DiCaprio's journey into the world of the climate crisis. In my experience, I knew that he represented those fighting for climate change, but wasn't aware that he was given the position of Messenger of Peace. I thought that a person who was better informed of the climate crisis from various scientific standpoints would've produced a more pressing argument, so I'm not sure if I necessarily believe that the best decision was made. I thought that certain comments that he made were quite out of pocket and uninformed, especially when talking to Sunita Narain, the Indian environmentalist. I think that he did a great job playing the part of somebody who was learning about climate change, and those who were uninformed about the effects of global warming would've appreciated the role he took. However, I simply cannot dismiss the fact that he seemed to expend numerous resources to observe problems that could've just been addressed by a scientist.  Even the comment made by one newscaster who said that a person who pretends for a living is now talking about a pretend issue made feel as though people would write off climate change even more with DiCaprio represented it, as if a true scientist couldn’t be bothered to represent the crisis.
         <br><br>

Certain things I did appreciate about the movie, however, were the connection between the Hieronymus Bosch painting and the rest of the world. I felt as though it tied the movie together very nicely and in the beginning I thought it was an extreme comparison yet by the end I was convinced that the painting and its chaotic ending could be very close to our own futures. We are in a state of purgatory, in a sense, and I think it makes sense to portray us in that light. The movie also served as a wake up call for those who weren’t aware of the palm oil and the beef industry truly causing the planet distress, and I think that was a good way to draw attention to the choice of our diets making a difference in carbon emissions. I think that Before the Flood did a great job of introducing a problem, I just wish that a more credible person was in charge of convincing the world of the issue.

After watching “Before the Flood” and "An Inconvenient Sequel", especially knowing about how much cubes of centimeter of ice and how much acres of rainforests have disappeared in the past several years, I agree with Leonardo’s standpoint towards climate change and I also approve of carbon tax, but I think he regards problems mostly from an elite’s perspective. In my opinion, the main problem is that economic development is unevenly distributed, which means the rich are able to afford the expenditure of energy conservation, as well as those developed countries. But what about the severe poverty in developing country? Elites announce that we could not cause pollution to our environment anymore, enjoying cheap merchandises at the cost of environmental pollution of developing country. at the same time, developed country often preserve their own techniques about energy-saving production, which is very improper and disputable. We an imagine that after closing many factories which caused lots of pollutions would lead to unemployment to a large extent, aggravation of inflation that are bigger loss. In this documentary, everyone says that as long as each country can act as environmentalist, we could reduce the pollution of environment. However, this thought cannot set up because of differences between countries in strategic, institution, especially economic and techniques. In the end, all we can do as a normal citizen are to take bus, buy energy-saving products, eat less meat, and vote for leaders who will fight climate change as much as possible, as for problems in national level, mentioning in the movie about fossil fuel interests and political party, let economist and energy experts research and solve them.

Having someone of Leonardo DiCaprio’s stature star in a documentary which describes in depth the dangers we face if we don’t fix our actions is exactly the combination that captures an audiences full attention. I found it extremely fascinating that while DiCaprio was filming a major film such as The Revenant, this opportunity also gave him the ability to travel across the globe and educate himself about what we have in store for us if we don’t begin to change. Also concerning this, I was beyond belief that a film star would take time out of his work life in order to view how we are destroying our planet and what we need to do to fix it. The idea of using DiCaprio to communicate this dire message in quick fashion is genius, as it draws in the interest of casual viewers like myself or my peers without us even having to have a shred of knowledge about the issue. However, even for those who do end up watching without knowledge on the subject of climate change, the audience is sure to leave with frightening images and the truth about climate change and what we are doing to our beautiful planet upon finishing this documentary. After finishing the documentary, I, personally, obtained a feeling of anger mixed with sadness which was very much in part due to the destroyed landscapes I viewed and the attitude world leaders had upon completing the Paris Accord. To think that world leaders were completely fine with not creating any severe punishments for countries who didn’t play their art in reducing their carbon emissions and keeping global temperatures well below a 2 degree increase is mind boggling, considering that mass polluters such as China and India don't necessarily have anything to be worried about if they do (theoretically) decide not to cut down.

<p>
I can't help but think about the fact that the United States withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement. The film presents the agreement as a step in the right direction while being pragmatic regarding its limited scope. While the agreement set a precedent of nations coming together to address the crisis that is climate change, it lacked enforcement capabilities and practical reforms such as a carbon tax. Instead, the agreement merely called for countries to try to achieve the goals established. Despite the lack of ambition of the Paris Climate agreement, it was apparently still too ambitious for the United States as they pulled out in 2017. This fact depresses me.  

         <br><br>

As mentioned by the film, industries that are fueled by coal and fossil fuels hold major influence within politics and society. For me, this film put into perspective the little regard they have for basic morality and ethics as they continue to destroy this planet's ecosystems in pursuit of profit. The film demonstrated the power of such industries and showed their connections to prominent politicians. I see why congress had such a negative reaction towards the Paris Agreement.  
         <br><br>


This film really shifted my perspective on Earth. From the pope calling it our collective home to the astronaut showing precious and delicate views of the Earth's atmosphere, this film did a excellent job of illustrating to me just how finite and sentimental this planet really is. To see factories on such large scales and their effects devastating human populations was shocking.

In “Before the Flood”, one of the most interesting interactions occurs when Narain and Di Caprio discuss India and its lacking quality of life for the less affluent. In this conversation, Narain brings up how people from first world countries often spout platitudes about how developing countries should move to solar energy instead of having to resort to more crude methods for energy. Narain’s comments on these statements put into perspective on how little these people, who most people likely share similar opinions to, truly understand about the situation of the world outside of their own and their own privilege. People from the first world are able to stand on a higher moral ground and condemn developing countries emitting greenhouse gases because they have the privilege of living in a far more advanced society that can afford to care about the environment. This makes situations such as the situation regarding the Amazon rainforest more complex because the farmers prioritize their present state of living over a future that seems decades away to them. 
         <br><br>

Narain’s comments depict the other side of the argument on the effect that developing countries have on the environment. Perhaps the most striking part of the conversation was when Narain pointed out that America itself is not doing as much investing in solving the problem as it should be considering that it is the second-greatest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world. This plays into environmental justice, as the people of America are consuming much more energy and therefore emitting more greenhouse gases than the people of third world countries, yet it does less to solve the problem of climate change than India does. I believe that this conversation as a whole is eye-opening in clearing away the ignorance of the people that look down upon those from the developing world.

The film "Before the Flood" is really a meaningful film. One sentence said by an islander impressed me a lot. He said: "The small island nations who contribute the least to the process of climate change, are actually going to feel the worst impacts, the worst scenarios because of global warming." It made me think: are we selfish when burning those huge amounts of fossil fuels without thinking about what is gonna be the consequences and harmful results to others who share the globe with us together? Can we take action and decline the use of fossil fuels right now in order to save our planet? I wish people in every nation in this world should start to replace fossil fuels with wind and solar energy like the Netherland and Germany do. And I also wish the US could join the Paris Agreement again to create a better world for the interest of all of us.

In the film Before the Flood, I noticed how a lot of the facts were not new to me. I felt as though I did not learn as much from this than I did from lecture, as much of the content was repeated from lecture. I noticed that this film was made in 2016, which leads me to be more skeptical of the statistics presented. Although it isn’t that old, I assume things have changed in the past few years and would be valuable to mention. I definitely did question why Leonardo DiCaprio was chosen to be the United Nations Messenger of Peace, given I knew nothing about him beforehand, other than the fact that he is an actor. But after watching the documentary, I can see why people decided to choose him, though I am skeptical of the implications behind him being a white man with quite a bit of privilege. 
         <br><br>

On another note, I thought the section on Gigafactories was very interesting. I had not known at all about them beforehand. It was eye-opening to see how just 100 of them could power the entire world with renenewable energy, and I particularly appreciated gaining insight into how renewable batteries are more sustainable than cable structures. This piece of information, I think, might be harder to come by, had the filmmakers been less privileged than DiCaprio. Overall, I think the film had a nice balance between pessimism and optimism, which leads me to believe it to be relatively neutral and reliable as a source.




</p><hr>


<p>
One of the things that mainly stood out to me at first was the fact that some people still refuse to believe climate change is occurring. People attack Leonardo DiCaprio for being an activist and claim that he is not a credible person which is extremely discouraging since anyone who knows climate change is in fact occurring can and will learn more about it in order to help prevent it. I like how the film showed the actual process of people ruining nature in order for us to keep what we have. In order for us to really make a change BIG actions must be made at the local level but also on a national and global scale. We are losing so many animals, resources, and much more by destroying our planet when we release these greenhouse gasses especially when you think of how small the amount of people who have access to these things are.

The film Before the Flood was a captivating film that explained many of the different aspects of the climate crises. It was strange and interesting to see DiCaprio in a role that isn't fictional; however it made his position as an an environmentalist unique as someone who was not familiar with the crisis, but has the capability to make a difference. I found the film  interesting in that it also provided a lot of strong visuals to go along with the information that it provides. I think the most striking visuals for be were the oil sands and the vast palm oil farms. Its amazing to see just the sheer size of the powerful palm oil farms that provide so many companies with a cheap immoral oil. The film really put your own climate practices in your face, with the focus on the beef industry targeting the individual. They claim that switching beef out of your diet is the best way to cut your emissions, a hard fact to argue against especially when beef is not a necessity. It was hard for me to see how many products were profiting off of the production of palm oil as well, mainly because I did not expect to be a as big of a consumer of it, but many food companies that I personally have bought are profiting off of the massively destructive palm oil farms. I can't lie however, that my favorite parts of the documentary were the scenes that provided a hopeful light. It was interesting to hear that switching over to renewable energy does not take as long as it might seem. This was especially seen when DiCaprio talked to people from countries that had actually switched to renewable energies. This uplifting thought has a double edge to it though; knowing that it is that easy to switch to renewable energy is also frustrating because it makes you think "why hasn't the us switched?" Its a sad reminder that a lot of these problems stem from greed.

Before The Flood was quite moving for me for obvious reasons, but for a greater reason because DiCaprio showed genuine interest to learn more about climate change, and worked to know more about it. I feel like if the population stepped up like this, then educating others on the topic of climate change would not be such a struggle, and would remedy the oblivion to the contributions of climate change. It was interesting to see each side of the fight; the innovative engineer, a disheartened poor woman, a politician in denial, and an activist and actor. Taking responsibility is the step that comes after acknowledging the problem, and that is why the problem needs to be addressed. I think that DiCaprio was an excellent perspective to take on this issue because it takes a well-known celebrity and exposes his base to real issues in the world. I think also featuring figures such as the Pope and former President Obama was a good choice because it intrigues and persuades the audience  when powerful faces are seen. Ultimately I wish more people took on more action. I think this movie, or movies like it should be required to watch in school; this is much more important than Of Mice and Men.

Before the Flood and An Inconvenient Sequel
         <br><br>
I watched the film “Before the Flood '' last quarter. It is the national geographic channel and Leonardo DiCaprio, as a United Nations Messenger of Peace, explored countries and regions around the world on climate issues for two years. Leonardo and his team visited the countries and regions associated with global warming, including the countries with the highest levels of environmental pollution and carbon emissions, the arctic and Greenland where pollution is affecting the melting ice caps, and the islands and coastal cities affected by rising sea levels. Find out how environmental authorities in these countries feel about these changes. When they came to China, they saw armed police cracked down on Kunming people's environmental protection and Beijing school pupils with a mask. Then they came to India, and their immediate impression was that India was even messier and noisy than China. Billions of people in India have three hundred million families who have no electricity. The film “An Inconvenient Sequel” also talks about disasters of climate change. Al Gore focuses on raising people’s awareness on climate change. He indicates flooding issues in Florida and Miami as examples. If the glacier melts rapidly, it definitely leads to massive flooding in Florida and Miami. Since people may think that global warming is something you've known for a long time and that it's nothing new to you, he emphasizes America should take action since “no other country can play the role the U.S. can play.” Most people have no idea about the seriousness of the incident or even doubt the authenticity of the problem. From my perspective, both movies are concerned about the consequences of global warming. Humans should pay attention to global warming. Otherwise,in either case, this will exacerbate the environmental problems, which in turn will boomerang back to humans.

I believe the film Before the Flood did a wonderful job putting everything together in a way that was easily understandable and highlighted the biggest issues of the climate change battle. Watching the film again was well worth it,  and after rewatching the film I believe the biggest issue hindering the climate change battle is awareness. Not enough people consider the future consequences of our gross consumption today and without enough awareness there will not be action. A small minority reducing their consumption against super corporations and a majority of people continuing to ramp theirs up as population rises and consumption increases will never win in the fight against the climate crisis. I was originally not all for Leonardo DiCaprio as a climate spokesman that was going to radically influence my climate change views as much as leading scientists or other professionals, but I realized you do not have to have a PhD to care or know anything about climate change, especially do anything about it. It made me realize that all kinds of people need to rise up and act against the climate crisis or the lobbyists, ignorance, and climate change will win. 
         <br><br>


The economy today revolves around the main contributors to climate change, and to reduce those contributors it must be by near unanimous action otherwise the world will resort to inaction and increase their growing levels of consumption. Fossil fuel consumption fuels the world as we know it, and unless the world seeks out alternatives fast, we are doomed to our fate of great global warming and the butterfly effect of consequences that follow with ever declining quality of life.

Looking at the documentary, Before The Flood, it is an interesting way to present the ever depressing issue that is climate change. As shown in the video, the movie allows the viewer to go on an adventure with a friendly, common face being Leonardo Di Capreo and on his adventure around the world the viewer is presented with a mixture of statistics and direct visuals that highlight the crucial issues that come with the issue of climate change. I personally found the opening section talking about Narwhals and how the researcher stated that he “did nit want to live in a world without these animals. An interesting concept presented in this documentary was the question of who will initially bear the brunt of climate change. While climate change has genuinely thought of to affect everyone and while technically true, there is the question, will certain people be more likely to feel climate change more and this documentary answers that question with a yes. Especially in 3rd world countries where the poor do not have the same luxury and lifestyle as those in the US. The worst part of these people bearing the weight of humanity's mistakes is that per capita an average person will have the equivalent carbon footprint as several dozens of an average Indian person.

Film: Before the Flood. This film was particularly captivating and brought many pertinent issues to light. Using Leonardo DiCaprio as a lens to explore the various aspects of climate change and what we can do about it made for an informative, yet relatable perspective that kept me engaged. 
         <br><br>


I was very interested to learn the ins and outs of the beef industry and the massive impact it has on the greenhouse gas Methane being released into the atmosphere. I didn’t know that the process of release had to do with the cows burps and overeating. I appreciated the explanation about consuming beef vs. chicken vs. pure plant-based and how each is on a tier of how good it is for the planet. For example, consuming chicken over beef is already 80% better for the planet. As a meat eater myself I can become more conscious about my protein choices and opt for chicken at restaurants and grocery store. 

         <br><br>

It was also eye opening to see real evidence of climate change and what that truly means. Before this class I did not know there was a difference between global warming and climate change and believed both to indicate something vague about the planet getting too warm. Now, after two lectures and watching this film I understand that we are in deeper trouble than simply global warming, the entire planet is or will face harsh weather and climate change that is unusual to past predictions due to human activity. We brought this upon ourselves. 
         <br><br>


I am hopeful and excited to learn more in these upcoming weeks.

After watching the film, I agree with you about how they used Leonardo DiCaprio as an asset to tackle climate change. Using a celebrity as a voice for these problems is a great way to influence people because they have a big impact on their community and fans. I was very surprised to see how our diet affects climate change so much. The amount of greenhouse effect that goes into the production of beef is astounding because it's one of the main sources of meat throughout the planet. Convincing the human population to start going on a plant-based diet is nearly impossible to do. People that I have met and that do have a plant-based diet, their reasoning is because of their health. I don't think I have ever met anyone that has said they do it for climate change. Seeing the evidence for climate change was very shocking to see. Knowing the difference between global warming and climate change has changed how I have perceived the topic. Global warming is a minor problem to climate change and now that we are seeing it, climate change needs to be seen as the only problem.

I had heard really great things about "Before the Flood" prior to viewing it so I was thrilled when this film was assigned to us. Before this movie, I was not aware of the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio was so involved in the climate crisis or took as much action as he has. I think the movie did a great job of laying out the stone cold truth about climate change and how much danger our planet is going to be in if we do not begin to take this seriously. Reading about the climate crisis is very informative and can teach people a lot about what is going on with the earth but there is something so powerful and impactful about watching a movie and seeing it with your own eyes. Personally, I find that the scare factor is much higher when watching a movie compared to when reading an article or a book. In the film, there are several scenes that were real wake up calls for me. I think one part that shocked me and got me thinking was when DiCaprio traveled to India and was interviewing those who live there about climate change. In one interview, he was interviewing a climate change researcher and during the interview she brought up how little the United States actually does when it comes to resolving climate change. It is extremely ironic how the Untied States does not put in any effort to solving this clearly large issue when we are one of the biggest contributors for causing climate change. I think it also shocked me because these poor, third world countries are doing way more when they have way less. As a country we need to ban together and take advantage of all our resources that could help us take on this crisis.

In the film "Before the Flood" we followed Leonardo DiCaprio as he travelled the world learning about our climate crisis. I found it extremely concerning to see him travel to places a close as Miami, which is now flooding and soon to be fully underwater. As I watched this I also thought about places like Venice, Italy which is essentially underwater and thought about what we could possibly do now to stop this. Sure in Miami they're building things to combat the flooding, but there's only so much we can do until the problem gets too big to handle. It was also really concerning to watch and see how certain news outlets would manipulate people into saying false statements that fed into their agendas. The fact that we are in the middle of a dire crisis and there are people willing to feed lies to the public to further, for example, their political careers is honestly upsetting. The images and videography of the film was both fascinating and nerve wracking as it showed how real the climate change is, putting images to the words. I also really surprised to seem that Leonardo DiCaprio had been appointed by the UN because as far as I knew, he was only an actor. That being said, I think it's really encouraging to see that he is using his influence and wealth to make a change in the world, and hopefully bring attention to the fact that if we don't start to change now, our time on the earth will be cut short.

In the documentary "An Inconvenient Sequel", AI Gore addresses the current circumstance of global warming. At the beginning of the documentary, Gore went to Greenland and witnessed the melting of the glacier. The scale of the glacier is still vivid in 20 years, but now there are a lot of holes in the glacier, which has caused the melting of the glacier. Immediately after, Gore elaborated on the situation in Miami: flooding the streets, suggesting the real existence of global warming. Gore's climate leader training has impressed me. From the first training, only 500 people listened, and now Gore has been giving lectures around the world, and environmental issues have gradually been recognized and valued. The clean energy that Gore mentioned in the training center, such as wind and solar energy, is very feasible in my opinion. Solar energy requires very little investment, which is suitable for vigorous development and can perfectly replace carbon emissions.
         <br><br>

I think the film did a fantastic job at teaching about climate change through Leonardo Dicaprio as he helps draw in a broad range of people. Through his learning of climate change, we are also learning about what is going on in our world. I think that through using an influential person in order to shed light on what is happening to our world, one is able to inform more people to take a stand and help become active parts in climate change prevention.

One thing that  really shocked me while watching "Before the Flood" was seeing the extremely harmful impacts of palm oil plantations. I've had people tell me to avoid vegetable oil or nutella because they contain palm oil, but I had no idea how many other foods do as well. Foods that I didn't normally think twice about, from cereals to chips to desserts, can have not only an unhealthy impact on our bodies, but a devastating impact on the environment as well.
         <br><br>

Seeing the displaced orangutans whose home forests were incinerated in order to make space for palm oil production made me incredibly sad. As the film reminded us, those in the rescue were "the lucky survivors"; many others were already dead. The thought that we're burning down rainforests and destroying the habitats of these animals just for our convenience, for a product that we don't even need in our diets, is truly astounding. Many people don't think about the wider impact of the foods they choose to buy and consume, but this film made me realize that we really do need to be conscious about what we're buying and where it's coming from, instead of just how conveniently-available it is to us.
         <br><br>

As Dr. Gideon Eshel said in the film, "If you want something that you can do, without speaking to any higher authorities such as government or whatever, I can't think of an easier out than changing your diet. You can start tonight." I'm now realizing that even though I made the choice to become vegetarian, there's still a lot more I can do. I see the need now to begin avoiding things like palm oil and animal products, and the importance of being mindful about the things I consume and their impacts on the environment. :)

In “Before the Flood,” Leonardo DiCaprio examines the climate crisis and some of its perpetrators [i.e. Exxon, the Koch brothers]. Celebrities using their platform for reform is amazing. Had Kanye West promoted HydroFlasks in 2013, the “save the turtles” (removing plastic straws) movement could have been started sooner. If celebrities rallied for climate change, had Jack Johnson a larger platform, environmentalism/sustainability could be taken more seriously. It’s a shame that people need to hear it from others, but Burger King introduced a meatless burger--which means environmental causes are beginning to be implemented in places we wouldn’t traditionally expect.
          <br><br>
I think DiCaprio does an excellent job of addressing climate change and the core of the issue: politics. If “97%” of scientists are in agreement that climate change is affecting Earth, the amount of opposition that scientists face should not be so prominent.

I watched the movie "Before the Flood" for the first time and found that Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't a great protagonist that would serve as the messenger of climate change. First and foremost, when his whole career is dependent on being an actor, it feels that he was just repeating information fed to him with no actual interest on the topic. I found his metaphor towards the painting in the beginning and end to be very cliche, doubting the fact that he paid that close attention to such as a child. Besides that, the rest of the documentary was very informative. It painted a narrative of the people against large institutions like fossil fuel companies and lobbyists in government who have so much control in our policies. It made me realize that we need to come together against these powers to change the world in order to save our home planet. The film did a great job of providing both pessimistic, optimistic, and realistic views on the whole situation all with credible figures. The call to action at the end of the film allowed us multiple options to help fight the climate crisis that I have not known before, such as changing to a plant-based diet. All in all, "Before the Flood" served its purpose as a documentary to inform the audience of the problems on the vitality of our Earth.

Before watching the film “before the flood,” I was like many of the skeptics in the film; I did not think Leonardo Dicaprio, an actor with no expertise in the field, should be the face of the fight against climate change. However, he proves himself and his commitment to this fight, going on some great research trips and doing many informative interviews that others likely would not have done. Even while working on his movie, he draws attention to the problems the world is facing. 
          <br><br>

Leo does a great job of pointing out how much of this problem is due to politics and money. The US calls itself a leader in combatting climate change, however, our energy and food consumption inequality is a driving factor to the problems we face. He also draws attention to those in power like Florida governor rick Perry who does not believe in climate change, even though his most populated city is slowly sinking into the ocean, leaving Miami to solve these problems themselves. Dicaprio even has an interview with the secretary of state, one of the highest levels in the US government, really trying to get to the bottom of this problem and draw even more attention to it. I actually think having Dicaprio as a spokesperson can be beneficial as he has a following and can spread much more awareness to those who may be uniformed.

The documentary, “Before the Flood” was a very enlightening experience, although quite aggravating. One aspect of it that shocked me the most was my discovery of how truly political climate change is as a topic. It's infuriating to know that politicians like Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, refuse to use the platforms they have been given to address difficult problems like the climate crisis. To make matters worse, corporations are even backing these politicians and compensating them for promoting climate change denial. I do not understand the motivation behind these actions; we all live on the same planet, so why are people acting like they will not be affected by the catastrophic events they are initiating. 

          <br><br>

This problem is only pushed further to its limit when the same people taking in money and publicly negating climate change are also scrutinizing the scientists who speak out on the problems we are facing. The film showed the abundance of scientists being harassed for expressing their concerns about climate change. I cannot fathom how people are attacking these scientists for “dramatizing” the effect of climate change that we have witnessed when the scientific proof is right in front of them. It really must be a skill for those who are only self-interested to be completely unaware of the world around them and how even if they are fine for now, their futures are also in jeopardy.

I think that the lecture raises an important idea that many would not want to know the truth about climate change. Just Ken’s question alone is a sad, sad reality that so many people are intentionally oblivious to the changes our planet is undergoing. I believe it is acceptable for one to be unsure of what to do about the problem, but to not even want to learn about the issue, to convince themselves nothing notable is happening is selfish and ignorant to me. There is a difference in not being able to be as aware or educated and simply not caring to be aware or educated. I liked that the film displayed this disheartening ignorance from our fellow humans, those in power especially.

          <br><br>

I resonated with the part of the film that shed light on the beef and palm oil industry, as I banned Nutella from my life the second I learned about the palm oil issue and have cut out dairy from my diet in contribution to the overwhelming methane production from cows. I specifically enjoyed how the film incorporated people of power, such as Barack Obama, Elon Musk, the Pope, etc. Even with Leonardo DiCaprio speaking for this issue creates a different watching experience than following an environmentalist who you do not know beforehand. Hopefully, others felt the same way about that as I did, such as being inspired by his persistence and lifestyle choices such as going plant-based. The way the film did not just revolve around the U.S. contributed in its effectiveness in opening the audience’s eyes into seeing that this issue is far greater than we may think.

I had no knowledge of Leonardo Dicaprio’s involvement and initiative in the climate crisis prior to watching “Before the Flood”, other than that he was falsely accused of funding the fires recently set in the Amazon forest by Brazilian President Bolsonaro. Though I am very much in favor of elitists or celebrities using their platforms to bring awareness to certain crisis, I am usually pretty skeptical of what actually is going on behind the scenes, because they are often individuals with carbon footprints that are leaps and bounds ahead of the rest of us (flying private jets and living in 10,000 square foot houses). Nonetheless, learning about Dicaprio’s environmental initiative in his own life (vegan), along with his efforts to spread awareness to others (UN Climate Ambassador), ultimately allowed me to dismiss my skepticism and approach the film with an open, unbiased mind. 
          <br><br>


In regards to the rest of the film itself, I believe it did a very effective job in encompassing the complex nature of the climate crisis, offering unique perspectives and insights to scientific, political, economic, and social aspects involved. I am dumbfounded in the realization of how many people (especially those in highly influential political roles) dismiss any notion of our Anthropocene and climate change’s existence. Dicaprio’s conversation with President Barack Obama was a very intriguing segment in regard to the overarching political situation, as well as a personal perspective on the matter. Obama stated that those who have no romantic or sympathetic connection to their environment (thus leading to a dismissal of climate change) will eventually have to deal with the consequences and threats to national security that have the potential to occur. I agree with President Obama that we should not be fully settled with the Paris Agreements, but should also be optimistic about the agreement’s implications as it has set the blueprint and architecture for the nations across the world to begin working towards effective solutions to combat climate change. Many people remain hopeless in regards to the fact that there are so many politicians who reject climate change and essentially combat its movements. But I agree with Dicaprio and Obama when they discuss how the public essentially controls these politicians; the more informed and aware the public becomes, the more politicians do. Ultimately, it is in our hands to keep pushing the matter forward if we want to see true, widespread change take place.

For this week’s film assignment, I watched the one named “Before The flood”. At first, I have no idea about what this film is about from the title, but after watching the film, I realized that it is such a masterpiece that could cause tremendous public influence. From my point of view as an audience, this one has a truly organized structure. Leonardo started and ended this film with the picture hanging above his cradle. It has the three pictures of stories related to the Bible: Beginning of the world, when people are getting overpopulated and Before the flood. The film implied the three stages to be the same for human beings, and we’re currently at the second stage. This is an alarming news that could wake everyone up to protect our environment. 
          <br><br>
 After watching this film, I felt deeply sorry for living in a developed country and never thinking about saving energies. The U.S. has the biggest economy in the world, and we should be responsible for global warming as leaders in the world. However, developing countries like China and India are investing much more on green energy such as solar energy than us. U.S. companies in the real world. In the film, the scene that I remembered the most was that Leonardo was questioned by the Indian woman about if the U.S. will take action to cut off our fossil fuel consumption. From her eyes, I can see no trust in Leonardo. She shakes her head to imply that she won’t believe we can make the changes, which is why I think we have to make some changes.
           <br><br>
 After all, I think this is a great film that everyone should have a chance to watch, so hopefully this video will be spread out to more people and make people notice this one.

This film reaffirmed that Leonardo Dicaprio is a brilliant advocate for the battle against climate change. He uses his platform to shed light on the most important issue of our generation. He acknowledges that he is not an expert on climate change but still wants to learn how he can best make a positive impact on the environment. This film is compelling because it offers icons from all spheres encouraging people to take action to make a difference. People are heavily influenced by the opinions of celebrities so it is important that other celebrities follow Dicaprio's lead and set a fine example. This film also provided jarring statistics that made me feel great concern for the future of our planet. The bit on ocean acidification was particularly shocking because I was not aware of the fact that so many coral reefs were being destroyed as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Although much of the film made me feel anxious and worried, I felt at times optimistic by the simplicity of certain ways in which I could reduce my footprint. After watching this film I have decided that soon I want to try to stop eating beef and hopefully one day become fully vegan. I think that few people realize how much power that individuals have in ameliorating the climate crisis. I think this film also did a good job of providing a global perspective as it showed examples of environmental damage in countries all over the world. This film exposed companies for using ingredients that ravage the environment but allow for a raise in profits. I was not aware of the palm oil industry's detrimental effect on the environment but after watching this film I would like to try to stop eating products that contain this ingredient. Films like this always leave me with mixed emotions because I feel empowered to make personal change but also worried that very few people will be willing to do the same and that my own contributions will be inconsequential. I hope that the media continues to expose large corporations so that they feel pressure to practice more sustainable methods of production.

<p>
This is a commonplace topic: human beings exploit oil and coal resources in large quantities, consume beef in large quantities, which leads to a large amount of CO2 and CH4 output, global temperature rising, coral reefs dying in large quantities, Arctic glaciers melting, and floods coming. Human beings are doomed. The whole film also revolves around this theme. I have some ideas after watching this movie
           <br><br>
1. Compared with the way of moral call to warn people that they should live a low-carbon life, the carbon emission tax is actually a better way. People certainly know the importance of environmental protection, but when turning the key to turn on the car engine, few people will think of the concept of low-carbon life. The nature of shortsightedness is still impossible to change. Only when the damage is embodied in every detail of life, can it stimulate people and remind people of their grand mission to save the environment. And when the idea is really popular, most people's decisions will further influence the attitude of politicians. Although the problem still exists, when carbon tax is imposed, other taxes will be reduced, so this is just a tax transfer
           <br><br>
2. Maybe you think the topic of global warming has been known for a long time. It's nothing new in your eyes, but please don't think it's common sense and sneer at people who don't understand it. Most people have no idea about the seriousness of the incident, or even doubt the authenticity of the problem. Because in reality, there are some people who are playing the role of obstructing the solution of global warming. It is just seeing this that some people who pay attention to the fate of nature and human beings begin to act.

In “Before the Flood”, I found it appropriate for someone like Leonardo DiCaprio to lead the film. While different from the standard person due to fame, success, and a vast amount of money, DiCaprio is very much on the same level in terms of scientific knowledge, curiosity, and the urge to make some sort of difference, and with his stardom platform, he’s able to bring this scientific issue into the lens of an average viewer. 
           <br><br>

The most impactful part of the film for me was the shot where they showed how much ice has melted in Greenland (30 feet), per the ice melting around the hose, and then seeing all that water run off into the ocean. This is a strong visual for how exactly the sea levels rise as a result of climate change.



</p><hr>


<p>
This documentary was informative, but it kind of seemed like it was more about Leonardo DiCaprio's reaction to the climate crisis than the climate crisis itself. It was definitely alarming to see the extent to which climate change can be seen all over the world though.

The film, "Before the Flood" is an important film that I believe everyone should watch and consider. The documentary was both captivating and informative. The information in the film was devastating to hear, especially when paired with videos that display the visual damages. It is true that a picture is worth a thousand words. I personally did not know that Leonardo DiCaprio was a strong advocate for the environment. His choice to be vegan is very admirable, after all money creates demand and if more people choose vegetarian or vegan options, the meat industry must shrink to match demand. It is a well known fact that the meat industry is one of the worst offenders in the growing climate crisis. Not only is it expensive to raise cattle into adults, requiring huge swaths of land for feeding purposes, but they also produce methane which is by far worse than CO2. Despite this, red meat remains a huge part of the American diet and few are willing to give up beef. Even choosing to eat red meat less without necessarily completely cutting it out would be a huge step in the right direction. 
           <br><br>


Ever since I was in elementary school, I learned about the melting of the Arctic and Greenland. Notably engrained in my memory by visuals of polar bears stranded on melted ice blocks surrounded by water. I hadn't realized the severity of the melting and the effects it would have on other forms of life and further damages. The once reflected sunlight could become easily absorbed by darker waters which would exacerbate the heating process on Earth. Even more visually disparaging are the bleached coral reefs caused by acidification which in turn destroy the rich ecosystem that survives off the reef and is a major food source for the coasts.  
           <br><br>


 The Paris Agreement has good intentions but it is not enough. It is far too lenient and has no consequences. I hope there will be more done on a global scale to reduce carbon emission. I was very interested by the concept of a carbon tax. If carbon had a price attached to it, more people would think twice before consumption. Money is a huge driving factor, everyone wants less taxes and cheaper prices. If a carbon tax were enforced, it could potentially greatly reduce carbon emissions. This tax could push the creation of non carbon emitting technologies that do the same things and create a more environmentally conscious society.

<p>
In the film "Before the Flood" DiCaprio travels around the world to learn more about the impacts of climate change and discuss contributors, solutions, and the future of climate change. I like how the film addressed that DiCaprio was facing outside criticism for not being a climate scientist and being an actor and showed that although it's true that he isn't an extremely well-versed climate scientist, he has been in the climate conversation for years and is humble in his advocacy for climate change. I think a film like this is very important because it not only shows the real-life and current impacts of our changing climate but also having a big name person in this film makes it a bit more digestible to the common person and the information more likely to reach more people as its launched off DiCaprio's wide-reaching platform.



</p><hr>


<p>
After watching "Before the Flood", I felt this great motivation to make a difference in my own life to combat climate change. There is something about documentaries that is much different than reading about world crises in articles. When I see first-hand via film what people all over the world are going through. In a close to home example, it was incredibly interesting to me how Florida is choosing to combat climate change. Building new infrastructure that will help protect its citizens from rising sea levels to me, is devastating. To know that we have done so much damage to glaciers and the poles that we now have to figure out ways to cope with flooding is very sad. 
           <br><br>


Another part of the film that was interesting was when Leonardo went to China to see just how bad the pollution really is. With China being the worst polluter in the world, seeing the damage the country is sustaining as a result of their multitude of factories was very sad. It's always crazy to me to see first-hand accounts of people living in horrible conditions due to climate change since we aren't really affected by it in our immediate lives (with the exception of California's air quality and wildfires). 

           <br><br>

Lastly, I find it very inspiring that Dicaprio chooses to follow a vegan diet. The movie shows the implications of the beef and agriculture industry and quite frankly, they are devastating. I don't believe that everyone needs to go vegan to make a difference, but I believe that the sacrifice of red meat and other foods with large environmental impacts should happen at least a couple times a week. For me personally, eating a vegan diet is something I'm striving to do in 2020, and watching this movie further cemented my decision.

           <br><br>

Overall, this movie was incredibly informative and really did a good job showing the effects of climate change with the help of first-hand accounts, celebrity cameos, and good use of statistics.

Before I watched Before the Flood, I had almost no idea that Leonardo DiCaprio was involved with environmentalism. I think it’s great that such a famous person is actively working to help solve the climate crisis. I appreciate that he immediately acknowledges that he still needs to learn despite being designated by the UN. I’m glad that he still cares about the movement despite being attacked for various reasons, such as flying and being an actor, not a scientist. Since scientists mostly agree on the climate crisis, I feel that most of the attention and action needed should also be from non-scientists, be it famous actors, politicians, or the average person. DiCaprio shouldn’t be mocked for being an actor and lacking specialized scientific knowledge, but should be applauded for being willing to learn and stand up. In fact, even scientists can’t know everything about climate change due it being such a broad topic, so it’s unreasonable to expect DiCaprio to be an expert on everything. 
           <br><br>

Around four minutes, Ban Ki-Moon compares Earth to a small boat. He continues, saying that if this boat sinks, then everyone will sink together. This comparison reminded me of lifeboat ethics, where some people may or not sink, while others are secure in the lifeboat. Perhaps Ban Ki-Moon was alluding to how, unlike the lifeboat scenario, everyone will sink if the Earth sinks. Instead of deliberating how to assign responsibility, which possibly hides pushing off responsibility, we should all work together because it involves all of us. If the Earth becomes uninhabitable, then all of us will struggle, developed nation or not. Ideally, it’d be great for everyone to recognize that, but people like avoiding issues that don’t seem pressing. I think that people like to deal with issues only after they’ve started, instead of preventing issues. I think some people are still intending on doing that with the climate crisis, not recognizing that climate change has begun ages ago. Climate deniers and skeptics won’t face the issue because it’s not pressing enough for them, so it can be avoided, delayed, and procrastinated on.  Many won’t act or change until it’s too late. It’s not fair that some people have to carry the burden of others who refuse to carry it, but, unless laws are created and strictly enforced, I think it’s a sad truth that the burden of solving the climate crisis will remain unfairly distributed. Sunita Narain makes some great points regarding the U.S. as a whole, such as pointing out how the U.S.’s consumption is extremely significant. Similar to how developed countries pointed to Africa’s huge population as a marker of huge consumption, American NGOs have told Sunita Narain that “the world’s poor should move to solar,” asking why the poor have to make the same mistakes as the U.S. and other developed countries. In a way, this is deflecting attention away from the U.S. who is still a country addicted to fossil fuels. Narain points out that, “if it was that easy, I would have liked the U.S. to move towards solar,” pointing out the hypocrisy. I respect her for calling out the U.S., but I also respect DiCaprio for having to sit there and have the hypocrisy of his country politely pushed in his face on film.

Prior to viewing the film Before The Flood, I was completely unaware that Leonardo DiCaprio was involved in the climate crisis in any way. That being said, the film does a great job in informing people who are not involved in climate-change activism about the dangers of the climate crisis. A large part of this is DiCaprio's central role as the main character and narrator of the documentary. His influence and position as a celebrity actor is effective in targeting the younger, movie-watching demographic, especially because he goes into depth with his commitment to the cause, setting a good example for those who look up to him as a person. For instance, I can see how many of his fans will follow in his footsteps in lowering their carbon footprints, taking steps such as reducing meat consumption and participating in protests. In addition, I love how he not only travels around the world to see first-hand the effects of climate change, but to connect with victims and scientists to further explore the climate crisis. 
           <br><br>
On the other hand, I am unsure that this film will do enough in convincing executives and higher-ups, those who have law-making power to influence environmental and business policies, to prioritize the well-being of our planet over money. While DiCaprio's position works well to appeal to the majority of people, it is easy for others to dismiss his efforts as nonsense or as having ulterior motives. As shown in the segments with the news channels who target DiCaprio's actor background to undermine his credibility, it is very difficult to overcome the cemented beliefs and greed that many people possess.

The documentary "Before the Flood" effectively summarizes the main issues and their progression towards catastrophe in a digestible and approachable format. It's strength is in highlighting the fact that global climate change affects everyone on the planet. It's effective in that it not only advises the audience to do things that directly impact the environment, but also participate in the world politics that lead protective laws and efforts against greenhouse gasses. Those that are in power have the ability to push their agenda at the cost of the lives and comfort of others on the planet. As a result, country laws only reflect those that can benefit off of ignoring the problem that is climate change.

           <br><br>

The documentary helps audiences from more developed countries and more stable living situations to empathize with those that are at the forefront of the destruction of climate change. It shows that not just the wealthy, but also the middle class have a enormous impact on climate change. Ironically, it shows that those living in impoverished countries contribute less to the dilemma but are punished the harshest. In providing examples of climate change from places and background all around the world, the documentary provides a very personal and insightful narrative.

The film “Before the Flood” follows Leonardo Dicaprio’s journey as he travels to different parts of the world, seeing and discussing how they have been affected by climate change. These affects serve as a form of evidence of climate change, yet, as the film also depicts, there are still an immense amount of people, many of whom are politicians, who strongly believe that climate change is some sort of make believe concept. Ironically, many of these people work for fossil fuel industries and benefit from the vast amount of money that is made from them. This benefit is obvious evidence as to why so many choose to ignore the clear indications that climate change is a real thing, one that is negatively impacting our planet and the sake of its future. Many of these indications were brought up throughout the film, such as when a once vibrant coral reef was depicted now to be completely dead, along with when Dicaprio presented a hose that was once completely under ice, now visible due to the massive amount that had melted. Evidence such as these examples, along with the many other displayed in the film, only point to one thing and that is climate change. I truly don’t understand how some people can be so oblivious to this ongoing issue, and it worries me how far they will let it persist until they realize it’s seriousness.

An Inconvenient Sequel illustrates the overall consequences climate change has on the world today, as well as following Al Gore through his journey to help raise awareness and try to solve the climate crisis. In both, Before the Flood and An Inconvenient Sequel, there is substantial overlap through the evidence provided illustrating the negative impacts of climate change. For example, both films focus on polar ice caps melting and how due to this, sea levels are rising, which has detrimental effects on places such as Florida where they are seeing extreme flooding. These films are similar in the way that they follow the journey of influential figures, Leonardo Dicaprio and Al Gore. However, they differ in the way that in Al Gore’s first and second films, they spend a significant amount of the films proving Al Gore’s credibility, while in Before the Flood, Dicaprio is publicly humiliated for getting the United Nations Messenger of Peace position. Dicaprio receives backlash after getting the position, while Al Gore received backlash for his claims on climate change and the consequences it will have on the world. 
           <br><br>


I was shocked when Al Gore explains that in his movie, An Inconvenient Truth, the most contested scene was the animation that sea-level rise and storm surges could produce flooding into the 9/11 memorial site and later on that is what exactly happened. Even though this scene was believed to be highly exaggerated the animation eventually came to life. It was also super interesting to watch Al Gore’s process and dedication to helping developing countries, mainly India, convert to more renewable energy sources such as solar energy. However, it is important to note that in every step of the production of solar panels fossil fuels are required. Another compelling facet of the film, An Inconvenient Sequel, was the insight into Georgetown, a city in Texas. The mayor of Georgetown goes on to say that they will be the first city in all of Texas to go 100% renewable and once they do they will be the largest city in all of the US to go 100% renewable. The mayor also touches on the fact that they are the “reddest city in the reddest county in Texas but it is our duty to our ratepayers is to provide them with the lowest possible utility cost,” he also goes on to say that from a common-sense point, putting less stuff into the air the better it will be, regardless of the science behind it. I think this is an extremely relevant point that climate change should not be a liberal versus conservative debate as it needs to be an issue all of humankind can get behind regardless of your political standpoint, because climate change impacts all of us, not just one group.

After watching “Before the Flood” I believe this was a very educational video. Although people may not want to face the actual facts of climate change, they need to. We need to make it uncomfortable for people because that is what may really bring change, and I believe that this film did that very well. In the beginning of the video DiCaprio talks about being upset with the past people because they would wipe out a whole species and it made me realize the saying “history repeats itself” is true! We are in the middle of another mass extinction and if we do not stop what we are doing people in the future will be mad at us as well. My final take away from this video is that we need to be aware of who we put into office. We will see no changed if we keep allowing politicians to be bought. The root of climate change comes from people in the senate only working for what massive corporations want.

Before the Flood: In this National Geographic documentary, Leonardo DiCaprio educates and reminds society of the massive ramifications of our current carbon footprint. Throughout the film, DiCaprio explores how the globe is suffering as a result of rising temperatures, from increasing sea levels to decreasing forests. Similarly, the documentary elegantly conveys the dramatic impact of present temperature changes on people and their way of lives, such as the devastation of Indian fields as a result of obscene rainfall. Additionally, he utilizes interviews with major leaders of the world to help tackle the urgency of climate change, from speaking with Barack Obama in Washington D.C. to Pope Francis in Italy. The academy-award winner is constantly stressing the need to switch towards renewable sources of energy to avoid any further catastrophic events caused by climate change and implores viewers and officials of the ever-increasing need to start working harder for the future of our planet.

I believe that Leonardo Dicaprio was a successful ambassador for climate change and the necessary action it requires in the film Before the Flood. In comparison to Al Gore in An Inconvenient Sequel- who utilizes ethos and logos to establish his credibility as an activist- Dicaprio is a great example of someone who comes off as ‘one of us.’ He is someone wanting answers, and someone who is relatable (despite even being a major actor). His down to earth charisma and genuine approach to the topic of climate change are sincere to the viewer and his journey around the world in search of answers is coherent and informative. 
            <br><br>
Before the Flood does an impressive job of showing off the tangible effects climate change has already had on our Earth. From scoured jungles scarred with deforestation to wildfires and flooded cities, the film doesn’t just talk about what can and will happen with climate change, it talks about what is happening already. The visualization of these effects, not just reading them in an article or hearing about them in an interview makes them that much more impactful and in all honesty, terrifying. It also heartbreakingly captures how the most profound effects of climate change are ravaged on the countries that contribute the least to it. Within my own lifetime and even beginning now, for the first time in our history we will be (and are) seeing climate refugees whose once habitable homes have been destroyed by rising sea levels and unprecedented weather conditions. 
            <br><br>
It is hardest to hear how the world looks to the United States as a model country, and how we have failed it in the actions we have taken in response to climate change. If the United States is failing to implement clean energy and CO2 emissions caps, how can we expect developing nations, desperate for even the luxury of electricity, to not turn to cheap and affordable fossil fuel energy sources. I’ve personally never been angrier at our country than watching and hearing this revelation, and I had to even pause the film and take breaks to not let myself become overridden with anxiety and frustration. As good as I found Before the Flood to be, it is something I wish I never even had to watch in the first place. It is such a shame we have come this far already.

(An Inconvenient Sequel)
            <br><br>
The aptly named film elucidates both the severity and polarizing nature (pun intended), of the climate crisis. At its core level, I think that the universality of the issue should overcome the petty squabbling that is commonplace in American politics today; even though a warming of the globe affects all people regardless of their political views, it remains tied to politics in modern America. Although I understand skepticism of the apocalyptic scenarios resulting from climate change from individuals who do not know any better, the same complacency from world leaders and owners of energy-related companies is unacceptable. Economic prosperity should be an afterthought when compared to the guarantee of destruction that will follow from the continued consumption of fossil fuels.
             <br><br>

The blame should not lie with developing nations though, as they are simply trying to follow the model for success that more developed countries like the United States and China have demonstrated. The blame should lie equally between the developed nations that have gotten us to this point with the climate and hesitate to change their ways, and between energy companies, like "Solar City," who would rather increase their profit margin than help solve the problem. The reality of it is, both of these bodies are not putting as many resources as they can toward actively solving the crisis, and should therefore be considered the largest proponents of the problem. China and the United States have the fiscal means to subsidize the establishment of renewable energy in the developing world, like the United States ultimately does with India in the film, and this should be a common occurrence. Further, the United States should provide some incentive for those in the beef industry to reallocate at least a fraction of their resources elsewhere, thereby not negatively impacting those people's jobs too heavily, and contributing greatly toward a solution at minimal cost to the United States.

The film “Before the Flood” is a documentary that discusses the current environmental crisis and how it has affected earth on a global level. It also talks about Leonardo DiCaprio's support to help end the climate crisis. Prior to watching the film, I had no idea that he was ever an advocate for environmental health. Dicaprio's large platform as a popular actor and highly influential individual make him a perfect candidate to help end the climate crisis. I feel better knowing he uses his platform to educate people of the environmental problems we currently face. Knowing what our problems are is the first step to change. With American media portraying third world countries as the large contributors to environmental destruction, people are susceptible to believe it. However, the United States is extremely hypocritical because most of the environmental damages that exist today are produced by the wealthy. 
             <br><br>

The film also talks about how food plays a huge role in polluting the environment. While I had a basic understanding that veganism helps support the environment, the meat industry contributes to more pollution than I realized. The beef industry is a large contributor to carbon dioxide emissions. Cows release huge amounts of carbon dioxide back into the air and the run off from these farms create uninhabited rivers. It also requires a large amount of resources such as water and energy in order for these farms to operate. Switching to veganism is a huge step to lowering carbon dioxide emissions in our atmosphere. 
             <br><br>

This film has also taught me that small steps are important. For example, Leonardo DiCaprio promotes himself as a vegan and has influenced some of his fans to do the same. Completely changing one's lifestyle too fast is unrealistic and won't be sustainable. Take small steps such as using a reusable water bottle, eat vegan a few days a week, and walk more. From there people can transition to more extreme measures. Being in denial will only hurt us in the long run, and being aware of the problems we face will allow us to make the necessary changes to a more sustainable future.

As everyone has mentioned, It is quite a brilliant idea for this documentary to take on the perspective of a world-renowned film star, which if he is talking about the issue of Climate change, the audience would take his words at a deeper level compared to some other actor whom they are not familiar with. Meanwhile, it is quite an interesting choice of the narrator they picked as an actor instead of a scientist, which it actually quickly shortens the distance between us and DiCaprio since both people on the side of the screen are no experts of Climate crisis. Despite DiCaprio being the messenger of peace in UN, he is still a student on the topic of Climate crisis like us, having a lot to learn about the reality we are facing too. Therefore he can take us along on the same boat discover the truth about this issue, while itself being an educative and informative experience for him too. Instead if it is some random scientist with an alien name sitting in front of the camera preaching about Climate crisis, it quickly widens the gap between the audience and the narrator as we would not be as personally connected and quick to lose interest. Reading cold statistics and informational graphics can be educational, but embarking on a virtual journey to expand our vision on multiple aspects of the climate is definitely another kind of experience that is more profound, and leave us pondering at the end of it. 

             <br><br>

Another thing that strikes me hard is how steadfast DiCaprio is standing on his view on Climate change despite many negative comments and critics he is facing against. It is not easy as a prominent public figure to fight against these much pressure, and we definitely need more celebrities or important to stand up and combat or advocate for actions against climate change. I love his passion for fighting for a better for the future generation and respect him for willing to take physical actions to let other people join in the front line of the battles. I believe he definitely establish a firm model for all of us to follow suite to stand up and take actions starting from ourselves

I think that the rhetorical device used in "Before the Flood" is extremely effective. As someone who is often bummed into inaction by climate documentaries and articles, I have a hard time being inspired unless I have a protagonist that is coming along on the journey with me. This same method is used on many children's shows when something is being taught, like the alphabet. The children believe, "well, if Kermit the Frog is learning the alphabet, I can do it with them". There's also the more direct route that Dora the Explorer takes in which she literally breaks the fourth wall in order to hold a mini-lesson with the viewers, pausing after she asks questions so that the kids at home answer the questions out loud to themselves. The point is, we've been using this device for years with children because we know it works wonders. Why wouldn't it work with adults when teaching them about climate change? Here is your guide, Leo Dicaprio, and for today's lesson, we will be learning about how we are all doomed to a violent end! As long as I have a guide, I feel like there's hope, and that I have an example to follow. "Cowspiracy" used this device and was the only documentary I watched that actually made me make a change in my lifestyle. 
             <br><br>
Once of my favorite things about "Before the Flood" is that it balances disturbing and beautiful imagery so well that you never want to look away in fear of missing some of the amazing cinematography, no matter what the shot is. You never know if what you will be shown next is a stunning landscape, or a destroyed one. This contrast not only makes watching the film compelling, but shows the effects of climate change in a depth that many other documentaries are unable to.

I hadn't seen the film "Before the Flood" prior to this class, and I was pleasantly impressed with it  overall. Initially he had my attention with the use of the painting “The Garden of Earthy Delights,” it continuously serving as a representation of our own world and the circumstances we find it in. This personalized element of the films structure helped me put myself in the shoes of DiCaprio's 'character' in the film, it almost feeling like I was on the journey along with him. With each destination and discovery of the effects of climate change happening already today I found myself more and more discomforted by the amount of things I was unaware of pertaining to this issue, and I think DiCaprio put it best when he said that the more he learns about the issue the more he realizes how much he doesn't know. I have to admit- that, is precisely how I feel... and the more I learn the more disheartened I am. I appreciated the fact that the film took into account other places in the world and not just the U.S. because here we live a life of comfort and I agree that it is the underdeveloped regions that are now seeing the first effects of this catastrophic mess. I found it interesting and beneficial that the scientists such as Professor Gidon Eshel held DiCaprio responsible as an American because this is an issue that our country MUST start considering. One particular part of the film that struck me was the portion on the island communities that are already flooding due to rising sea levels. Seeing the kids there, just among the flooding homes and villages put things in perspective for me. This is happening now, as we speak, as we live, and we must act now. 
             <br><br>

Regarding the question of DiCaprio's level of ignorance to the issue in the film, I feel like this is certainly an effective rhetorical device the filmmaker employed. He expresses a level of awareness I felt I could relate to and it made the film ultimately more successful because he puts himself in the position of realistically most Americans in regards to climate change awareness. It made it relatable, convincing, and effective.

Prior to watching Before the Flood, I did not know what I was getting myself into. I was pleasantly surprised with how interesting the film was. 
             <br><br>

I liked how the film brought all the points back to The Garden of Earthly Delights painting
            
that was above DiCaprio’s crib. I recognized the painting from my art history class, and I agree with the connections made between the three panels as three phases of the Earth. We are knowingly bringing ourselves into the third panel.
             <br><br>

DiCaprio was the last person I would have thought of to be a leader in climate change. Throughout the video, he proved to be a very worthy leader. He is humble; in the beginning on the film, he admits that he is not a climate change expert but is willing to do whatever it takes to learn more about the issue and what changes can be made. Later on, he even says he they have may have picked the wrong guy. I like the analogy DiCaprio said comparing his job to the climate change. He says, “I pretend for a living and it seems like people are doing the same when it comes to the climate change.” I can feel the frustration DiCaprio and other climate change activists feel trying to solve a global issue that the public cannot take seriously. I respect DiCaprio for standing his ground even when he was receiving backlash for being a Hollywood actor fighting for environmental change. At the end of the day, anyone can be a supporter of climate change. It just takes passion and determination.
             <br><br>

Going into the film, I also felt like I had a good understanding of the climate crisis. However, as I watched the film and learned more, I realized that there are still many parts I do not know. I was not aware how big climate change denialism was. It frustrated me when I found out that many climate change deniers in the United States senate were recipients of fossil fuel money. As long as fossil fuel companies still have funding, this activity will only continue. I also did not know that global warming does not mean the entire Earth becomes warmer. In the film, I learned that some parts of the world, like Europe, will actually become colder. The public needs to be further educated about the climate crisis before change can be made.
             <br><br>

I agree with what Sunita Narain said about Americans. Americans are not leading by example. I was shocked when I found out that electricity consumed by one American is the equivalent of 34 of India and 700 million households in India use biomass to cook. Action to help climate change needs to start in the United States, not undeveloped countries.
             <br><br>

I liked how the film gave a potential solution for the climate. For the United States, a change could start by issuing a carbon tax. I agree with DiCaprio, a carbon tax would be a major shift in the right direction. Americans have to realize that global warming is not a problem for some of us, it is a problem for all of us. Like Philip Levine said, “The ocean is not Republican, it is not Democrat. All it knows how to do, is rise.” The carbon tax would force Americans (myself included) to use energy wisely. While the Paris Climate agreement was a step in the right direction, it failed to keep countries accountable.
             <br><br>

By the end of the film, I have a much better understanding about what our Earth is enduring right now. Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job educating the audience about the issue of climate change and global warming. By traveling around the world, the audience is able to get a good idea of how global warming is really affecting people and the environment. I would highly recommend this film to family and friends. I feel motivated to change aspects of my daily life.

The film, Before the Flood, showed firsthand the pre-stages of the climate crisis that Earth is going through via the narration of Leonardo DiCaprio which although at first seemed like a surprise to me I wanted to better understand how the same character from The Revenant and many other great films has achieved the necessary credibility to become a UN messenger of peace. An interesting confession from DiCaprio was that although he had been shown as the face for climate change on many occasions he himself was naive and didn't fully understand the seriousness of climate change as seen when he mentions speaking to the former vice president. DiCaprio's journey to various different nations and his willingness to perceive the issue at hand through different lenses from those who don't have a voice to those who do and choose to ignore it for monetary gain adds credibility to his position further. The biggest question I had going into the film was how will DiCaprio's presentation manifest what our reading by Wallace- Wells told us would happen. When DiCaprio goes to the Icecaps and sees how the land is watery and far from frozen over I got to see first hand the rate of how these lands are melting and creating giant rapids that are being released straight into the ocean which would lead to the rise of sea levels thus flooding coastal cities like Miami and the disappearance of small islands as seen on the Before the Flood website which uses the Solomon Islands as an example. A perspective that heavily captured my attention was Dr. Sunita Narain whose struggle to provide sustainable energy for the people in India and to be able to deal with how the actions of countries like the United States and China have left them with flooded farmlands and over 400 million people without power who have resorted to using cow dung as a source of power. Most importantly, her perspective sheds light on how many developing nations face a damned if you do and damned if you don't, the situation when it comes to being able to provide for their growing nations. This in part, displays as the film progresses how the US's importance towards the beef industry has had an immense impact on the rest of the world and how the dedication to this system is sending us in a negative path. On the other hand, what impacted me the most was how governments are so easily allowed to be corrupted by corporations through the investment of our elected officials to maintain ignorance. For example, a large part of our elected officials receive over a million dollars to continue to reject the climate crisis so that oil companies and many other companies can profit off the American people. Most importantly, this can be seen when the film proposes the possibility of a carbon tax which would shift taxes from the majority payroll of the people to the corporations and allow for sustainable energy sources to be emphasized rather than continuing to pollute the world through the consumption and creation of fossil fuels. In the end, I felt that this film was a great example of how the world is struggling to maintain itself and how the actions of the few are many times affecting the many.

In the film “Before the Flood”, Leonardo leads us to the problems of climate change. The distinction of species, global warming, and rising of the ocean may destroy our world. However, there are still people who do not believe that climate change will bring disaster to humankind. Maybe some of them are really unaware of the problem, but someone must deny the negative impact of climate change for their own benefit. For example, some politicians and capitalists are trying to get more support to cover the problems caused by climate change. In fact, human development will inevitably cause damage to the environment. The film mentioned that industry and animal husbandry caused great pollution and waste. With the improvement of technology, these factories and companies can reduce pollution, but the high cost of technology will make them make a lot less money, so few people will do it. Maybe some policies should be introduced to protect the environment and delay climate change.

<p>
The film “Before the Flood”, was an eye opening documentary that showed first hand evidence of the effects of global warming across the globe.  Speaking to the production strategies of the film, I believe that juxtaposing the clips of Leonardo de Caprio speaking about the harmful effects of climate change and the visual representations of what we as humans have done to our planet (and what we are continuing to do to it) with opposition refuting the very clear evidence has a very strong effect on its audience.  By presenting facts and statistics and pairing them with politicians who are still trying to say that climate change isn’t real presents the listener the realities of our given situation and makes the other side seem unreasonable and ignorant.  

             <br><br>

By having such a wide array of media platforms in this one documentary has given the audience is able to sympathize with each individual animal, habitat, or person that is feeling the real effects of climate change in this day and age.  This is no longer an abstract concept, this is real, and this is happening now.  By presenting us with so many different perspectives, you are able to see how many different fields are interested in this topic-- emphasizing how urgent the matter is.  From interviews on the slush and water in the North Pole to newscasts that show actual footage of extreme deforestation to frack and sell large amounts of oil.  Exposing people to the actual footage of what continuing on this wasteful, CO2 producing path is doing to innocent people and animals, it gets more people talking about it and it spreads the message and the information to so many breadths of people.  We need to keep hearing and talking about it, because an issue this big cannot get swept under the rug.  We need to hold the big companies responsible for their actions and start some real progress towards saving our planet.

I found the film "Before the Flood" extremely interesting especially in the regard that Dicaprio takes a look at multiple different countries and their take on the Climate Crisis. I think one of the most interesting takes from all the countries is from India where she is pointing out the hypocrisy of the US and the climate crisis advocacy that takes place where they place a lot of the blame onto often poorer countries and advocate for changes in those countries while never looking back at the US and all of the issues that the US is causing regarding the Climate Crisis. Another really important part of the film is the discussion about palm oil production,  which I feel is not often talked about a lot but is definitely detrimental to the environment. I think it is especially horrifying that it is in a lot of the major products that we consume in the US but not a lot of focus is brought onto just how awful it is for the environment. Overall this film really summed up the largest issues pertaining to climate change and gave a lot of very interesting points of view on the issues and proposed solutions to them that I felt the film is a very important one to watch to see the full scope of the climate crisis.

This film differs from typical environmental films as it strays from the science and brings your attention to the politics that truly lead towards change. I enjoyed how this film follows Al Gore through the movement he has been on since the 80s. 
             <br><br>

Initially the film begins at the Swiss Climate Station depicting the real detrimental effects climate change is having. The rise in temperatures is melting the ice at an accelerated rate which is then causing flooding in coastal cities all over the world like in Florida. Al Gore presents the irony in how many Floridan politicians do not believe in climate change when they are being the first to be affected by it. In addition, it was inspiring that despite political background a Republican Mayor of Georgetown, Texas became the first city in Texas to go 100% renewable. Thus, encouraging others to do so, he brings up that it is the rights of his citizens to have low cost energy which is why he made the switch.
             <br><br>

I also found it inspiring that despite losing the presidential race Al Gore was passionate about informing others of the climate crisis that he started a Climate Leadership Training. Despite only 50 showing up to the first session, when later these same trainees are trailblazers in the climate change movement. The film then goes behind the scenes of the Paris Climate Conference that was crucial to global awareness of the issue. This event was monumental and when Trump removed the U.S from the agreement I felt like Al Gore, defeated. However, I appreciated the compelling speech at the end of the film that gives hope to this movement.

<p>
Film "An Inconvenient Sequel" 
             <br><br>

This film focuses on the climate crisis and shows not only the events happening at the time surrounding the modern climate crisis but also the politics behind it all. Al Gore emphasizes how the climate crisis continues to worsen and how quickly all the effects have been created. He hosts trainings in which he goes over all the impacts the melting of the glaciers and greenhouse gases are having all over the world. Sea levels are rising, the oceans are retaining heat, which has made natural disasters more frequent and dangerous. We are living in a warmer and wetter world and this has also increased droughts, and therefore fires have also become more common. What baffles me the most is that Al Gore is often questioned for his work even while there are examples happening all over the world related to what he is talking about. He literally shows what is happening in real time and is constantly updating his presentations to reflect current events, yet he is still questioned.
             <br><br>

A big part of the film surrounds the the Paris Climate agreement. This was meant to be an agreement among every country in the world to reduce greenhouse emissions as much as possible before 2050. Al Gore was one of the representatives for the United States, and when it was passed it was a huge step toward helping the climate crisis. However, once Trump became President he removed the United States from the agreement. Trump removed the US from the agreement because Republican politicians typically are funded by the same big money corporations that would benefit from the use of fossil fuels, motivating them to vote against all climate change reform even though scientific evidence exists. While this was a big loss, Al Gore's students who attended his training were becoming some of the main leaders in the Climate Change Movement which shows that his work was not taken for granted and will continue to fight to make a large impact.

The documentary, Before the Flood, was very well put together to give the audience a general idea of what are the problems that cause climate change and what are some of the solutions to change the damage we have done to this world. It was interesting to see the perspective of the highest countries' carbon footprint on climate change and what they are working on to reverse the effects of climate change. China is the highest emitter of carbon into the atmosphere has realized that their daily lives are causing this drastic change of temperature throughout the world and not just in their geographical area. I really like how the 3 highest emitters of Carbon, which is India called out the United States on not acting urgently to reduce their own carbon footprint. Sunita Narain, Centre for Science and Environment for Delhi told DiCaprio that the U.S. has to put their money where their mouth is with respect to become a solar country. 
             <br><br>

The U.S. is the second-highest emitter of carbon into the atmosphere and we are one of the countries that pay their leaders, people in congress to confuse the public about climate change. It is not right that a country that contributes so much to carbon emission is letting huge companies pay congressman to confuse the public to make them believe climate change is a hoax just to those companies can some money on palm oil which emits large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. 
             <br><br>

The Paris Agreement is a great step forward to reducing carbon but I was surprised to find out that there are no penalties for not following the agreement. There isn’t a carbon tax or anything that will ensure that the agreement is being put to use. 
             <br><br>

Even though climate temperatures have risen that it is putting our planet at risk, astronaut, Dr. Piers Sellers is happy to tell us that we can cool down the Earth by reducing our carbon footprint. The temperature may till rise for a little bit after we stop using fossil fuels but overtime the temperature will start to decrease cooling down the earth.

In the documentary “Before the Flood” Leonardo DiCaprio travels the world to personally see climate change in action and how many populations are suffering due to it. One aspect of the film I found the most interesting is that the Unites States, one of the most powerful nations in the world is not making any changes to acknowledge the impacts of climate change. Being such a powerful nation, it is not setting a good example for other countries to follow and is pressuring other nations to lower emissions while being completely hypocritical. It is also a country with one of the largest greenhouse gas emissions, in addition to not having a very large population compared to Africa or India.
             <br><br>
 Although China may be the largest polluter in the world, the difference is that they are quickly and rapidly switching to renewable energy sources. This is the change that the US needs to follow; however, this change was influenced by the constant riots of the angry citizens living in the “Airpocalypse”. Therefore, I believe that in order for the US to begin making efforts to renewable energy, the citizens need to prove to the government that they want change and are not complacent to pushing the earth to the point of inhabitation.

Before the Flood covers many parts of the world to record the devastating effects of climate change. The reliability of the information makes people more aware of the urgency of solving environmental problems after watching. The impact of climate change on the planet has never been single but multifaceted. I think the most amazing thing about this documentary is that it focuses on the diversity of objects, from polar bears to islanders. Moreover, this film explores and reports on the carbon tax that is rarely reported. I feel very novel. I think this is what this documentary wants to bring to the audience. From different perspectives, the problem often has different gains and can be more comprehensive. The meaning of a documentary is to report on social issues to make people aware of the seriousness of social problems and encourage people to take action to solve these social problems. After watching this documentary, I also began to think about how to protect the environment and alleviate climate problems in my daily life.

<p>
The film “Before the flood” is a pretty effective tool to present to the audience with the tragic consequences that global warming has brought about and how these outcomes are closely related to our daily life. The narratives are conducted from the point of view of the famous actor Leonardo Decaprio, who also has the special title as the UN Messenger of Peace in terms of environment. The actor himself is actually a public figure who could reach a wide arrange of audiences. So the film “Before the flood” became some of the most famous clips about environmental protection and the global climate crisis which seems to me personally a very convincing documentary.
             <br><br>

In this documentary, many consequences of the climate crisis have been brought to our attention thorough investigation, interviews with some prominent figures in the field, as well as the actor’s life experience. I really pondered upon the section where Leonardo went to India and critically reflect on the current global situation. The poor 50 percent of the world population is only contributing to 5% of the total carbon emission according to Professor Hiltner as well as the documentary. The developing countries such as India could have no means to put environmental protection as the nation’s priority when most of its people are still trapped in the poverty cycle. With that in mind, the most developed countries of the world such as the U.S contributed some staggering amount of carbon emission of 25% of the world’s total emission. And yet people in the most developed countries live the most “luxury” life-- that their carbon footprint would be the highest in the globe. This fact doesn’t just seem unfair to me, but it is really the truth and the most difficult issue to solve in reliving global warming. It is hard to change the lifestyles that people live for nearly a century, especially for those whos commercial interests and economic power are based on the carbon industry. So taking actions would mean a lot and seem impossible to these developed countries. 
             <br><br>

Then what could be changed? Or in another way, are we destined to be unable to solve the aggravating global climate crisis? Fortunately,  this documentary included many ways that human are already combating global warming-- the solar and wind energy advancement in China and increasing carbon-free countries in Northern Europe. These are good news to the world, although these efforts may not necessarily be applied to all countries in the world. But what really triggered me is the fact that there are still people who kept denying global warming even after they see the consequences. Some political entities in Florida are still denying and blocking the measures to rehabilitate the consequences that had already happened in the city of Miami regarding global sea-level rise. That is something that needs to be changed immediately, otherwise, not only people suffering from the climate crisis get unfair treatment but the environment would be so much at stake.

I thought “Before the Flood” was very informative, comprehensive, and used an effective approach to the issue of climate change. I found the film’s focus on the political aspect of the issue to be very interesting. Prior to watching the film, I didn’t know as much about the corruption and money behind the politics of climate change and denial. I feel like after watching the film it is easier to understand how corporate lobbyists and other wealthy individuals can influence politicians, and how the public is being sold “climate denial” by the big fossil fuel companies. I also appreciated how the film seemed personal and real, as they went to all different areas of the world, and showed how the climate crisis is affecting real people and their communities. After watching the film, I feel somewhat optimistic as it did provide suggestions on how to help the climate at an individual level, like eating less meat, and voting for politicians and policies with thought and consideration.
             <br><br>

At first, like many others I’m sure, I wasn’t entirely certain about Dicaprio’s credibility on the issue of climate change, as I know him just as a Hollywood actor, and I don’t think special credibility should be given to anyone just for being a celebrity. However, throughout the film I learned more about his dedication to environmental activism and I appreciated how he portrayed himself as though he is still learning and curious, just like the viewers. Also, I admire how he is using his status and fame to bring attention to the climate crisis.

The film "Before the Flood" showed a truly eye-opening look on the behind-the-scenes actors of the climate crisis. All of us know that fossil fuels are causing massive environmental catastrophe and that politicians are not as effective as they should be in solving problems. However, I don't think many people realize the extent to which corruption and pure greed play in causing these problems. The film does a good job of exposing this to show some major causes and villains in the climate crisis. 
             <br><br>

The film exposes how we lack political courage to do something about the climate crisis. Many people prefer to think about other problems or like to think that they can address the climate crisis after they've addressed other things because they falsely believe that climate change is an issue of the future. Even people who do know of the present and real danger that the climate crisis poses to every single person on the planet are afraid to rock the boat to do what's necessarily. On an evil and sinister note, many people are purposefully profiting off doing nothing about the climate crisis. Many politicians are controlled by greed and are being bribed by giant fossil fuel companies to do something to address this crisis. They try to save face by saying that the economy can't handle the kind of radical change necessary to properly address the climate crisis. All I say is there is no economy on a dead planet. 
             <br><br>

The greed of fossil fuel companies even takes a step further into violently trying to protect their profits (aside from all the mass human suffering and human rights abuses causes by the climate crisis). Scientists who study just how extreme the climate crisis is sometimes received threats and are black labeled as alarmists who are stirring up chaos to prevent them from honestly reporting their findings about the gravity of the situation. 
             <br><br>

In addition to exposing all of this, I think the film did a great job of humanizing this problem. Showing how the dying planet will affect everyone on the entire planet is a powerfully important thing to do. In the United States, many are in such a state of privilege that it is easy to ignore the climate crisis and pretend that it will not start until the future, but showing the dramatic effects of sea level rise in Florida, for example, strongly highlight that we are currently facing the consequences of the climate crisis and we must act now if we don't want save ourselves from facing the most sever consequences of the crisis.

Before the Flood was an extremely influential and captivating documentary. Leonardo DiCaprio showed how all the natural beauties on the earth were being demolished by global warming. The film encourages humans to make a change before it is too late but it does not address solutions. The film only displays all the damage, dangers and threats to the earth. The fact that Leonardo DiCaprio was the narrator of the film makes the film widely appealing to individuals because of his famous legacy in acting. I believe this would enhance the films popularity while also opening the eyes of individuals who don’t exactly know the extreme extent of damages due to global warming. It was astonishing and terrifying to see how 30ft of ice was melted in the span of just 5 years. I was also shocked to see how severe sea level rises were. The whole city of Miami was practically underwater and the city created a project that costs them 4.6 million dollar project to drain the water back into the ocean which will only be good for 50-60 years. We may be able to create temporary solutions but as time goes by, it may be too extreme or costly to fix. Visually seeing the flooding and all the damages impacted me greatly because I was able to get an actual feel of the scenery. Also, seeing the extent of industrial pollution in the air of Beijing and the helpless faces and riots of individuals who live their was very saddening. The film did an amazing job with all the breathtaking graphics and imagery; I think that was my favorite part of the film because I felt like I was there along with him traveling the globe. I would definitely recommend this film to family and friends because it is a documentary that addresses a variety of issues rather than a specific genre or concern. It is also pretty clear, concise and straight to the point while also allowing me to feel urgency and pressure of time we have in finding a solution or making a change.

After watching the film, “An Inconvenient Sequel”, my eyes were open to the multiple environmental crises occurring all over the globe, all a strikingly clear reflection of accelerating climate change. Of course, I was aware that some poorer countries still utilize harmful forms of fossil fuels and contribute to pollution, but this film revealed intentions. It is so easy for Americans in a privileged position to urge other countries to introduce alternative energy sources without considering difference in living conditions. For example, Al Gore visits India and speaks to ministers about the tipping point of climate destruction and the promise of wind and solar energy. While one minister understood American’s strides towards renewable energy, he also provided the reality of his position in a vulnerable underdeveloped country. In an impactful explanation, one minister says, “After I’ve used my coal. After I’ve gotten my people jobs.” This statement shook my belief systems and offered a new perspective that takes into account the progress that underdeveloped countries have to endure. In order for Indian civilians to simply survive, they rely on the damaging fossil fuels that we slander in the US. While the environmental damage is alarming, coal fuels India’s economy in the way that we can afford to prosper through solar energy. Our strides are not equivalent to others. It is heartbreaking to know that because of India’s desperation to stay afloat, they are viewed as outdated and foolish. If we dive deeper into economic and societal issues, the story isn’t as simple. 
             <br><br>

Furthermore, Gore emphasizes the irreversible damage that climate change has projected onto natural disasters. Prior to watching, I already had the knowledge that climate change can affect the pattern and severity of hurricanes, but I enjoyed being assured the extent of its extremism. Gore explains that recent hurricanes have been significantly momentous because of the unusual environmental conditions in which they are brewing. In a “warmer and wetter climate”, storms are developing to be more severe and dangerous, the film showcasing the Philippines’ struggle to stay alive during hurricanes characteristic of tsunami-like rushes of water and separation from loved ones.  On top of worsening natural disasters, there are also melting ice caps and cascading glaciers. All in all, this film was great in the sense that it encompassed a plethora of different but equally alarming side effects of our changing climate, from Miami coastal floods to Portugal’s deathly heat waves. However, Gore’s heavy involvement in politics honestly made me a little skeptical towards what he was saying. His speech seems so articulate and persuasive that I wonder if I am getting legitimate information myself. On the contrary, I am a huge believer in the absolute breaking point we are at in the climate crisis, so I appreciate Gore using his passion to urge others to acknowledge it is a problem.

“Before the Flood” really captured my attention. I connected with the visuals, facts, and explanations of real world problems and possible solutions for the climate crisis. The documentary did a great job in exploring different parts of the world and seeing how several countries are affected by climate change. In addition, it presented the complications of solving this issue quickly. For example, human greed was a prevalent theme all throughout the documentary. When large companies continue to use fossil fuels and destroy our planet little by little every day, it shows how severe coming to a solution truly is. Sunita Narain’s harsh but effective explanation on how America will end up destroying life on earth impacted me. It was certainly brave to tell an Leo that his country is a major factor in climate change, and he must do something about it. 
             <br><br>
The solutions given in “Before the Flood” seemed very reasonable for most peoples’ everyday lives. For example, simply restraining from eating meat often will make a difference bigger than I previously thought. The carbon tax solution is good, too. It’ll prevent major companies and people from using carbon, therefore preventing the emission of this gas into the atmosphere. Overall, the documentary contained some somber moments where I thought, “there’s no way climate change will be stopped before it’s too late.” However, I do believe that this human-made problem can be solved with enough political action, along with cooperation with the rest of the world.

I have to say I really thoroughly enjoyed that “Before the Flood” was narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio because he sees the climate crisis through a more general public view- he understands that the problem is pervasive and on a scale never before seen, but doesn’t realize just HOW big of a problem it truly is, and therefore wants to do whatever he can to learn more on the topic and do his part as informed as possible. I felt that same way before I started watching. After watching and seeing how astronomical the climate issue is, it makes me rethink the choices I make in my everyday life that perpetuate the effects of climate change in a greater way than necessary. For example, the land distribution comparisons between beef, chicken, and crops highlighted how dangerous and unnecessary high-consumption rates of beef is for our Earth, and that by simply switching to even just chicken instead of beef, you can save a much higher proportion of land on earth that could be used for that regions natural ecosystem. 
             <br><br>

The film also made me realize just how corrupt our political system is regarding climate change. Politicians rarely act completely on their own belief- everything is decided based on their constituents’ views, and on who is donating to their campaigns the most. If a politician represents people who are avid climate-deniers, and if they’re funded by huge gas company CEOs, it doesn’t matter whether THEY believe in climate change- they will vote in favor of gas companies and in processes that won’t benefit the climate simply because they want to cater. It is horrifying to think that companies have such huge influence on both politicians and the general population, but it is also not that difficult to believe. Our society runs on greed and money, so of course those who have that privilege aren’t going to be willing to change anything because they see it as counterintuitive to their personal interests. It’s a really damning overview on the true difficulty of properly implementing effective climate change policies into the world.

While I had never seen the film "Before the Flood" prior to this course it did not surprise me all that much. I am, like DiCaprio, by no means "an expert" on the subject and have a lot to learn, but i've spent a lot of time reading about the subject in order to better understand my own personal impact. In the film they talk about how people don't think about their impact with every decision they make however I think that it should always be in the back of someone's mind. I do struggle with many of the decisions i make because i am aware of the affect it will have on the environment. I understand it's unfeasible to ask everyone to base every decision they make on such a large issue that no single person can fully comprehend, let alone solve, however it must be a goal to get as many people to be aware of their impact. Thats why I thought when the film talked about introducing a carbon tax, that widespread awareness might be well within the realm of possibilities. The film introduced many topics and ideas pertaining to climate change and presented them very well and through an understandable medium to try and get the word out.

Watching "Before the Flood" opened my eyes to some things involving climate change I wasn't aware of, such as the high number of people in India using biomass for cooking, and the further dangers of when these people get onto the especially unsustainable grid of India. The denial of educated people such as Congresspeople is further cause for alarm, and again plays into the hands of rich interests in fossil fuels who will not be around to face the consequences of climate change. I also learned that China invests the most into renewable energy. This further makes me believe that the US is the worst offender regarding climate change, along with the fact that we emit the most CO2 per capita. I also did not know the extent to which Elon Musk was involved in pushing for sustainability, with his Tesla Gigafactories as well as his push to make colonies on mars. Overall it was very eye opening and showed much about the pushback from climate change deniers.

Before watching the documentary “Before the Flood,” I thought I have already known the seriousness of climate crisis, but I did not expect that it has come to a horrible and sad stage. Climate crisis is always overlooked by some people because it is difficult to feel the change. What makes me unforgettable is that in the documentary, an old man, who hunt and fish in the high Canadian Arctic, said that they used to have solid, blue ice, but since it melted fast, now the ice is like “ice-cream.” Also, as it is mentioned in the film, in 2040, all the ice will be melted in North Pole, which will make the flood and drought more seriously. For the Paris Climate Agreement, its purpose is to keep global warming below 2 degree Celsius, but, in my opinion, it is hard to reach in today’s condition.

From the get go the film captured my eye when DiCaprio referenced the painting that hung above his bed as a child. I found it to be a little ironic and intriguing. When sin came in the world started to suffer and everything crumbled. Just like when we started to use fossil fuels and CO2 the world started to suffer. What I thought was interesting was how later on in the film there was a scene from Fox News where they said that the destruction on earth is more likely to be about Jesus coming back than humans changing the climate. It immediately made me think about the picture and how the people in the third panel in their hell were waiting for their savior while mixed in with the over populated toxic group of sinners; sounds familiar. 
             <br><br>

I do appreciate how much information was put forth. I had no idea that DiCaprio was so involved like this. I loved how he went traveling to really see what was going on. He got to see the North Pole before it melts away which a lot of people won’t be able to say. It makes me think about how many people aren’t going to be able to visit so many lovely places in the world simply because we’re destroying them. It’s also eye opening to see how many places are already ruined with pollution and melting ice caps. And most of these places impacted are places that are low income. The film does a great job portraying the struggles of climate change in an engaging way that always leaves you thinking more.

Overall, "Before The Flood" does a very good job of introducing the climate crisis to its audience. DiCaprio's choice to be a sort of narrator who is also trying to learn more about the issue is incredibly effective--it makes the viewer feel like they are learning more as DiCaprio is. Prior to watching this film, I was critical of how prominent DiCaprio was in the environmental movement (like how he was designated Ambassador of Peace by the UN) when it seemed like he did not do much to further solutions to climate change. However, I realize now that DiCaprio is doing a great job at spreading more knowledge about the climate crisis. He communicates the urgency and already existing impact rather eloquently. Moreover, DiCaprio being as popular as he is gives him an advantage in that people listen to what he has to say, so him using his position of power for good is something I think more celebrated icons need to start doing. Also, the fact that they paid a voluntary tax to make up for all the traveling they did while producing the film was a pleasant surprise. Just a little critical note, reading through the comments I kept seeing people say they were also surprised and pleased by it as well, but I think it serves as a reflection of the low bar (for lack of better phrase) we have set for celebrities and just wealthy people in general. I guess my point is--paying a tax for flying privately should be a normal thing to do, and not just with flying but with any activity that releases high levels of ghg's. Back to the film, the personal stories that were incorporated into the film really made it that much more impactful. It serves as a way to demonstrate that the impacts of the climate crisis aren't some abstract thing that happens in oceans and won't affect people until decades into the future, but they are impacts that are already being felt by many, many people around the globe. Something else that I found to be particularly striking about the film was when they revealed a bunch of facts and statistics about how corrupt the fossil fuel industry and how much money has been funneled to politicians to get them to comply with what they want. Lastly, I wish the film included more of an environmental justice element that showed the disproportionate impacts of climate change. It was touched upon with the islands that are already being lost to sea-level rise, but I feel it would've been nice if the film had gone more in depth...don't get me wrong though I think that the film was very effective and definitely captured my attention.

In the film, “Before the Flood,” Leonardo DiCaprio explores the horrors of climate change, both in what we have seen – showing dozens of snippets of fire damage, hurricane damage, etc – and what is to come in the coming decades. It is a horrifying film, meant to bring to light exactly what devastation has been done to mother earth at the hands of those meant to keep the earth safe. Humans have destroyed the earth, DiCaprio emphasizes, and they are continuing to destroy it – we will not be safe unless something is done. He dives into mining grounds, factories, the arctic, all aiming to show what is happening to our earth – it’s a rather well done movie, in my opinion, and one important to watch.

How do we effectively combat this climate crisis when our whole economy and our lives depend on the use of fossil fuels? This will be the gravest challenge of our generation and unfortunately generations to come. Those before us inherited a planet rich with natural resources and materials and they have exacerbated the planet to no end. Now we are confronted with the consequences of their irresponsibility and selfishness. Coal, oil, natural gas , are the bane of our existence - they have helped us create the world we live in and in doing have also become reason for our demise. 
             <br><br>
Leonardo Decaprio did a great job at creating an hour and half film that doesn't lose its audience with scientific jargon, but outlines the seriousness and complexity of climate change in a riveting and understandable way. Decaprio tries to understand the audience himself by searching for answers to questions we might have. Presumably, Decaprio is quite knowledgeable on the climate crisis as he was appointed a peace messenger at the UN conference;however, in his decision to relate to his audience, he creates a more genuine and relatable film. Many of us, or at least I have many questions about the climate crisis, and Decaprio did a great job at answering some of them. 
             <br><br>
If we truly want to combat climate change, politics and government is our key to addressing this crisis head on. Our government offices are plagued by corrupt politicians that turn a blind eye to the climate crisis, in hopes of short term profit. I don’t even understand how someone who receives money from large fossil fuel industries can be head of anything related to the environment, I find it quite ludicrous in fact. The fact that we are still combating climate denialism shows just how entrenched the fossil fuel’s claws are in our governing bodies.

In the educational film Before the Flood, Leonardo DiCaprio explores the worst places/things that are influencing the climate crisis. I think it is interesting and useful that he starred in the movie because people trust him because he is an actor. The most shocking parts of the film to me were how 1/3rd of the US senate is paid off every year around 2 million dollars by famous oil companies so that they won’t pass any laws about climate change and oil regulation. This film dives deep into the main anthropogenic climate issues that we are fostering today more than we ever have before and that as of right now, it is only getting worse.

<p>
The film "Before the Flood" is a great depiction of the climate crisis and the immediate need for action to combat it. The film effectively draws upon the root cause of climate change through the lens of actor Leonardo Dicaprio. Now although Leo may not have a large amount of expertise in terms of the climate crisis, the fact that he is using his built-up platform and legacy to raise awareness for this ever-so-growing crisis, indicates the need for this crisis is being brought to its harsh reality. Additionally, from a viewer standpoint seeing Leo in this film prompted further engagement and thus, this would allow for a greater widespread. 
             <br><br>


Effectively what is noted from this documentary that there are a lot of people who are unaware of the greater effects of the climate crisis and some who are in denial. This really comes to confuse me as we are shown and depicted evidence of the effects of the climate crisis. For instance, in the film, we are shown footage from Greenland. In this scene, Leo is being shown by a scientist an ice sheet, which was once 30ft deep in ice but due to the effects of the climate crisis, it now lays 30ft lower. This all happened over the span of 5 short years which really shows how quickly the earth is slowly descending into obsoleteness. What people need to realize and come to terms with is the fact climate change is real and is very prominent. If change isn't taken now then the effects of the climate crisis will be felt more harshly.

<p>
For me, Before the Flood was an attention-grabbing movie that furthered my knowledge of the scope and effects of climate change on our world. By showing many different countries and terrains and showing the interrelation of them - from ice melting in Greenland to forest fires in Indonesia and the possible daunting future for small, peaceful islands, the movie does a great job of capturing what is going on in our world. Another way that the movie depicts this issue very well is through DiCaprio interviewing very prominent people and leaders of our world today like President Obama and Pope Francis. 
             <br><br>
Before the flood has left me with mixed feelings. On one hand, the climate change crisis as portrayed in this video is appalling, and DiCaprio's outlook on the issue is very pessimistic, albeit for good reasons. With corporations and interest groups chasing after profit, spreading misinformation, and lobbying politicians, the situation is a tough one.  However, I am actually somewhat surprised and very encouraged to see the steps that countries are taking to help solve this problem, especially with the possibilities of alternative energy sources like solar and wind power. I was fascinated by Elon Musk's "Gigafactory," and with ideas like these I know we have the possibility to save our planet.
             <br><br>
In the end, however, I believe it is up to the common public persons to spread their voice and encourage change. The human environmental consciousness is rising, and the more people that are aware of this issue the better. The story of Sweden deciding to fully turn away from fossil fuels is an inspiring step towards a better future, and shows that it can happen in the United States and around the world too if the people encourage politicians to. We have the chance to do it now and save our planet, and I will do my best to ensure the health and safety of our planet so my grandchildren can live in a beautiful world.

An Inconvenient Sequel has been- by far the most moving climate crisis video I have seen; I've seen all the required films for English 22. 
             <br><br>

This films makes me wonder where the world would be if Al Gor had won the presidency in 2000. It's extremely frustrating to think about the fact that the world could be so much more environmentally advanced if Gore was Mr. President instead of Mr. Vice President. Could lives have been saved? Could wars be halted? Could we have met the Paris Treatment Agreement? Would there be more hope regarding this topic than despair? Would he have even been able to make a difference, with congress's slow moving pace? Would we be exactly where we are today, with Trump as president and the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement? I'm curious to see what would have happened if the US had such an environmentally aware president so early on.
             <br><br>

 The video does an amazing job balancing the feelings of hope and despair. This is fairly difficult to do, because if a film is too hopeful, it has the potential to sound ignorant, but if it's too despairing then the film can be criticized as alarming (similar to David Wallace-Well's The Inhabitable Earth). Al Gore explains the severity of the climate crisis while also highlighting the ability to move forward. He mentions several achievements of the renewable energy business. He shows that the world isn't completely silent. We are fighting for a better planet, we just have to figure out the best way to get there.

This film also made me wonder about the alternative routes our country could have taken and the results of those routes; however, I try to think of our current situation in the United States as not the worst possible one there could be. Sure, Al Gore could have made monumental waves in fighting the climate crisis if he had been elected 21 years ago, but at least he is still a figurehead in making people aware of climate change even though he is not a politician now. I get that it's easy to focus on how past events shaped negative situations, but I find it relieving to see people like Bernie Sanders and Greta Thunberg popularizing and encouraging the fight against climate change. Obviously, the federal government has control over things to an extent, but it gives me hope knowing that the climate crisis is a fight not solely bound to politics, but rather personal choice as well.
             <br><br>


An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power gives me hope in the collaboration of countries' efforts against climate change. Following Al Gore from country to country gives viewers great insight into the process of fighting climate change from a political standpoint. It was refreshing that the documentary tapped into the dangers of climate change but committed to a more optimistic narrative of Gore's plan of action to improve India's greenhouse gas emission. The most remarkable part of the film I thought was Gore's trip to Georgetown, Texas, because the mayor of the red city was a huge proponent of renewable energy. It showed me that the political divide in America does not necessarily exist with believing in climate change or not, sparking hope that all people in the US can unite in establishing a more sustainable country.

In the film Before the Flood, I was once again reminded of how much of an issue climate change really is compared to what the mainstream media makes it as. In the film, Leonardo DiCaprio visits various parts of the world that has been impacted by global warming. The scene where Leonardo DiCaprio measures the amount of ice that melted in the last 5 years shocked me, for that is a staggering amount of ice lost in the past 5 years. Speaking of Leonardo DiCaprio, I think the UN's choice was right. I admit, like the media, at first I was skeptical of DiCaprio's involvement in climate change, however the more I think about it, the more I feel like DiCaprio is a perfect choice for the UN. DiCaprio is a famous star, and has a sway over the younger generation no other candidate would have.
             <br><br>


I found the media's adamant refusal to believe that climate change exists to be incredibly ignorant. There are so many signs of global warming: ice in the North Pole is melting at an alarming rate, one can see the poor air quality of china, the waters of Florida is rising and flooding cities, and coral reefs are disappearing. Even with the signs, the media, and politicians call climate change a hoax and ignore the signs in favor for politics. All solutions they propose are only temporary, and do not fix the ongoing problem.

             <br><br>

I think in order to really combat global warming, everyone has to step up and do something about it. We can do our own part by reducing our personal carbon emission, stop feeding into the beef and palm oil industry etc. Like Obama said, we can not completely reverse climate change, however we can prevent it from becoming catastrophic.

Watching Before the Flood made a big impact on me in regards to climate change. I knew the basics of climate change and I've also read up on the statistics and it was very alarming and definitely prompted me to make changes in my lifestyle that would in anyway benefit the Earth (reduce CO2 emissions). Watching the film and seeing the effects of climate change on screen were extremely sad. We are really letting our Earth die. It is also very true that climate change is not just an environmental problem, it is also a political problem. The U.S. being a "leader" yet not addressing the problem of climate change and being complacent.  To add on, companies who benefit off of digging up oil and burning up other fossil fuels deny climate change and they make no effort to change their actions since they benefit from it. In other words, its a shame these big companies whose carbon footprint is extremely large care more about their self interests instead of the Earth. Climate change deniers or people who flat out ignore these problems are extremely frustrating especially when they are huge corporations. Many individuals might change their lifestyle such as go vegan or have an electric car, but it almost means nothing when giant companies continue to release large amounts of CO2. To sum up, Before the Flood was an eye opening documentary addressing important aspects of climate change-- how real it is and how we must take action fast since our Earth is falling apart as we speak.

After watching the film, “Before the Flood”, I think Leonardo DiCaprio proves to be a very confident and worthy ambassador of the climate crisis. From getting backlash and hateful comments from all around, he comes from not having much knowledge about the subject and researching and prospering around the world in order to have a better understanding and help with activism and making this film. 
             <br><br>
I like the metaphor of the painting DiCaprio explains in the beginning of the film and how it applies to the big picture of what our planet is turning into, but I also like how the film addresses the smaller pictures and deals at hand by simply zooming into the world and giving us personal experiences from around the world. It really put things into different perspectives and helps give us a better understanding of the disasters currently building and what actions need to be made in order to stop them.

Before the flood :             <br><br>

Like most other environmental or climate change documentaries, Before the Flood, follows the outline of first introducing the issue, then stressing the importance and urgency through real-world examples and future predictions, and finally ending on a hopeful note that says it is not too late to save the planet from complete destruction. This film took an interesting approach of having actor Leonardo Dicaprio be the protagonist. He isn’t someone who comes from a science background and he explicitly expressed that he felt he needed to be better educated on what is really going on. His incomplete knowledge is relatable to the audience of others wanting to know the truth about the dangers of climate change. It was good how Dicaprio used his status as a very famous celebrity to bring awareness to these issues. One thing I really enjoyed about Leo was how he was very self-aware. At one point during the movie, he states “I know my [carbon] footprint is a lot bigger than most” since most people who have money, such as celebrities are much higher emitters of greenhouse gases than regular citizens with their private jets and luxurious lifestyles. 

             <br><br>

One point of the film I enjoyed was when Leo was speaking to Sunita Narain about India's role in climate change. As they address, millions of people in India do not have adequate access to energy which leads most of them to burn biomass in order to cook or heat their homes, which while bad for the environment, it is the only thing most people can afford. Dicaprio then asked why India hasn’t turned to other energy solutions such as solar and wind and Narain responded, “I hear this all the time from American engineers. If it was that easy, I would have really liked the US to move towards solar, but you haven't. Let’s put our money where our mouth is” This brings up two major issues, one being environmentalism and poverty and the other being how many green-minded people, such as Americans, can be incredibly judgmental. Americans can not look to blame countries such as India for climate change when we are more at fault. 

             <br><br>

The movie did a good job of placing most of the blame for carbon emissions on the large companies who take shortcuts in order to make as much money as they can, as highlighted by the palm oil industry. However, it also talked about ways in which the individual can make a difference, for example with changes in diet. While the best way would be to cut animal products completely, it expressed that even just cutting our beef products can make a huge difference. The visuals of how much pollution is produced from cow agriculture versus chicken and then also versus plant-based made it extremely clear of how what you choose what you eat can make a huge difference.

I was amazed by the production quality and how relevant the information presented was throughout the documentary “Before the Flood”. I do feel like the persona that DiCaprio tries to portray and the ways the documentary goes to present ideas act as effective rhetorical devices that made me reflect on the issues of climate change. Although criticized as “an actor from Hollywood with no previous scientific training,” DiCaprio still followed his heart to learn more about all the issues that lead to global warming, and I think his role in the documentary really is an encouragement to us all. I think the film succeed greatly in capturing the current state of climate change, the main causes of climate change, and the opposing factors that abate the progress of combating change. When the film examined the current state and effect of climate change, victims across the globe were surveyed: from the city of Florida to remote islands. The various examples provided and interviews conducted show that climate change is a huge problem on an international scale and everybody would be affected eventually if inaction continues. The film started off stating that our economy is based on fossil fuels, which is true considering how cheap fossil fuels still are compared to renewable energy, but I was surprised to also see how much ranching is contributing to methane production and global warming. I would never know beef is the major cause of tropical deforestation if I did not watch this film. The film also provided insights on how politics and corporate greed play a huge role in preventing efforts of combating climate change. Politically, climate change bills are hard to be passed because there are deniers in the senate funded by the fossil fuel industry. Publicly, there are scientists or people with credentials that are willing to trade their credentials for money with the cooperates to raise public denialism.

Never in my life had I visualized what climate change actually looked like before watching this movie. I didn’t expect much before I started watching the film because I knew it had Leonardo DiCaprio in it, and I just wondered what he could possibly know about the environment (I did not previously know that he is an environmental activist). However, I judged incorrectly and it turns out that ole Leo is more knowledgeable than I thought, and more knowledgeable than me. The film did a great job of not only portraying what climate change looks like for us in the United States - such as the flooding happening in Florida - but it also shows the audience how different people were being impacted in different places, and even in places that were sparsely inhabited by people. It really puts into perspective how vast the effect is; not only are we directly being impacted, but we are impacting other people and affecting their quality of living, and just the quality of the Earth in general. 
             <br><br>


It really is emotionally wrenching when you really see what is happening. Actually being able to see what is occurring in other places that we would normally think would not affect us helps the audience understand that this problem is vast and serious. Even though we may not see an impact on our own personal lives, other people are experiencing the serious effects of climate change, and it is only a matter of time before that is us.




</p><hr>


<p>
In contemporary society, even though some people do not trust climatologist that climate is changed by human activities and the effects are catastrophic, climate change is real and urgent. Climate change is coming much faster than we expected, and we have seen extraordinarily extreme weather patterns. The problem is becoming worse and worse. In order to get fossil fuel, people take away massive forests and require a huge amount of energy, the waters and streams are poisoned, and wild life and native communities are impacted badly. I was shocked by a phenomena mentioned by the scientist. In 2040, we will even be able to sail over the North Pole in the summer because there is no sea ice left in the Arctic ocean. We are burning too much fossil fuels, so the ice is melting.

             <br><br>

Some governors still do not believe in scientists that human activities cause climate change. Part of them deny climate change just because they can get profit from fossil fuel companies. Thus, they do not support the plans that help the city, like Florida, financially. However, if we do not protect our planet, we and all the living things we cherished are history.

             <br><br>

Global warming is the most important issue in our generation and is happening right now. There are some useful strategies to change our current situation. For example, using renewable energy, such as wind and solar energy, is a good way. Besides, setting up carbon tax can reduce emission of greenhouse gases as well. The Paris Agreement also put many countries to work together to keep climate warming below two degree Celsius. Other than these, we also need to take an action in our daily lives. Our tiny actions may make a big difference to our planet.

The film, Before the Flood, focuses on the real consequence of global warming - sea level rise. This film really impressed me not only because the entire film was narrated by Leonardo, but also the environmental crisis that revealed by the film. As an environmentalist, Leonardo travels around the globe and shows us the environmental impact of global warming in different places, such as Greenland, China, India, and Indonesia. When Leonardo was in Greenland, I was shocked when I realized the amount of ice that melted in Greenland for the last 5 years. Another scene that impresses me is the conversation between the India lady and Leonardo. When the India lady pointed out the fact that Americans produce much more greenhouse gas than other countries, Leonardo was speechless. When we enjoy the privilege of using fossil gas, we don't care about the damage we have done to our planet earth. The film is very straightforward in conveying its central idea, that is, take action to protect our planet before it's too late.

Watching the movie “Before the Flood” was an enlightening experience. Leonardo DiCaprio is often mocked for being such an outspoken advocate for climate change, many believing that he has ulterior motives and simply wants to gain attention to further his acting career, but I think that regardless of his motives, what he’s doing is extremely admirable. We need more people like Leonardo DiCaprio and Greta Thunberg to use their voice and challenge the status quo because when it comes to climate change, we have been procrastinating and sitting on our laurels for far too long. It’s becoming clearer than ever before that the responsibility to do right by the planet and all its living species has fallen upon our generation. A call to arms is necessary and awareness is extremely crucial. Climate change is a global reality that is inescapable and subsequent generations will be left to deal with the ramifications of our actions, or lack of action.

Moreover, China often receives a lot of flack for its role in contributing to climate change and decade old pictures of city smog still seem to circulate the internet, presented as if that was still the country’s reality today. When I visited Beijing, I was prepared for terrible air quality and smog but was pleasantly surprised. The air quality seemed to be comparable, if not better, than that of New York, Los Angeles, Paris, or any other large metropolis. Therefore, I was glad to see that the documentary covered the positive steps forward that China has made to address the climate crisis. Finally, the documentary was also eye opening because it presented how climate change is affecting communities all around the world. I think that many people don’t see climate change as a crisis at all because they aren’t necessarily experiencing the consequences at home. In the case of the climate crisis, we cannot afford to let out of sight equal out of mind.

Prior to enrolling in this course I had seen both “Before the Flood” and “An Inconvenient Truth/Sequel” but chose to revisit “Before the Flood” due to a personal bias towards the film. “Before the Flood” was one of the first films I saw that addresses the climate crisis head on. I found “Before the Flood” to be a more accessible film for viewers with a non-science related background and the addition of Leonardo DiCaprio—as the “surrogate” for the viewer as Ken put it—of course made the film appealing to a wider range of viewers.  
             <br><br>

This film is rooted in the science behind climate change but instead of choosing an approach that relies heavily on diagrams or complicated statistics, the viewer is brought into natural landscapes aside DiCaprio as he discovers the harm being inflicted upon our environment and who/what is behind all of this. DiCaprio’s description of the large painting that was hung above his crib, “The Garden of Earthy Delights,” is used as a framing device within the film and has always been a moment within the film that has stuck with me. This personal anecdote that stems from DiCaprio’s childhood makes the whole journey a bit more personable for viewers viewers we are privileged to accompany him along this journey.
             <br><br>

There are certain moments throughout DiCaprio’s findings that he is admittedly pessimistic towards the climate crisis, specifically the detrimental impact that the Untied States and our industries have had on the environment. DiCaprio visits several destinations across the globe that experience alterations to their surrounding environment such as sea level rise, ocean acidification, deforestation, etc. Through discussing these issues with the people who are effected or scientists who study the effected areas, “Before the Flood” educates the audience on these critical issues in a progressive manner.

The film “Before the Flood” offers a variety of perspectives on the causes of global warming. The most shocking issue to me is how fossil fuel interests are affecting the U.S. senate to not have a climate bill passed. The fossil fuel fonded climate deniers occupy a great proportion of the senate. I have absolutely no idea why would it be legal for the wealthy to influence the house in this way. Shouldn’t they be getting arrested for corruption? In addition to that, I feel sorry for the climate change deniers. They profit from being ignorant about science facts that have blinded them to their own moral compass. For example, an environmentalist Dr. Micheal E. Mann was verbally attacked by Fox News and by the congressman for his “hockey stick” curve showing the abrupt global temperature rise in the modern age. 
             <br><br>


The real deal here is all about money. There are thousands of fossil fuels corporations profit from the absence of a climate bill, and most of them are publicly listed companies that prioritize revenue first. They are not likely to give up a portion of their profit to save the environment. I think it is of no use for the environmentalists to negotiate with these people. Bargaining with these powerful climate change deniers is just like suing the judge in a court -they are the ones who decide what is going to happen. Unfortunately, I do not know what can an ordinary citizen do in this “war” of power and money. The game is for powerful politicians and wealthy capitalists.

The film, “Before the flood,” did a great job of raising audience awareness of climate crisis. It is also a wake-up call for those who are still unaware of the seriousness of climate change and its horrible impacts. Comparing to listing datas and expressing terrible consequences through sentences, pictures, sounds and videos are able to depict the climate crisis in more vividly and convincing way. Moreover, “Before the flood” is not like the documentary I watched before. It is more interesting and compelling. That is because this documentary was shot in a special way: it recorded everything related to climate change based on Leonardo DiCaprio’s perspective. It made you feel like you have visited different countries and seen devastating scenes with DiCaprio together. It attracted my attention and didn’t make me feel boring during whole watching process.
             <br><br>

One thing I knew from this film that really shocked me: the relationship between politics and climate change. Sometimes politics attitude towards climate crisis will affect the public perceptions of climate change. People will not have the awareness of climate crisis, if politicians are trying to weaken the harmful effect of some behaviors. Some officials attempted to deceive the public about impacts of fossil fuel, because of the huge benefits from fossil fuel.

As I watched “Before the Flood”, I believe the most eye-catching attribute of it is the fact that it casted Leo DiCaprio as the main character of the film, there are barely anyone who dislikes the works of this extraordinary actor. Thus, I believe the main reason that this film received such a high rating is its choice of cast. Also, another fact that contributed the success of this film is its time of publish, 2016 was a year which Hurricanes were demolishing numerous cities globally, the United States was also a major victim. With all these people worrying about what’s coming next, Leo successfully provides the audience with the proper information and ways that could ease our anxiety about the future. As a college student, I have realized, to a certain extent, the so called “cruelty” of society, people would do almost anything for fame, power and money, thus explains such climate deniers who are benefitted by the corporates. I have watched an episode of “Patriots Act” in which Hasan Minhaj informed the audiences regarding the Koch Brothers’ actions against public transportation, and it was well expected that these corporates would cease any actions that could harm the profits of fossil fuels. 
             <br><br>
Before this documentary, I was well aware of the climate change issue, but as of now, I have gained more insights towards the anti-climate change side. I realized that these people are not at all ignorant in anyway, but in fact, solely greedy and power hungry. This is something in human nature that could hardly be altered, but I do not believe that these corporates would stand against the will of the entire population if everyone was well educated of the problem.

In “Before the flood”, Leonardo DiCaprio traveled across the world and explore the causes of global warming. Throughout his journey, he met and talked to people like Barack Obama, Pope Francis, Elon Musk, etc. He narrates his journey along the movie. 
             <br><br>
The part that resonates with me the most was when Leonardo DiCaprio was in my hometown Beijing, China. The effect of the overuse of fossils was directly affecting me and there were days when I took a walk outside and came back with my hair smelling like smoke. There were always a circle of air quality in Beijing: the quality of air become worse and worse every day until it become unbearable and then the government will shut down the factories surrounding Beijing for a few days; as soon as the air clears up, the factories opens again and then the air quality worsens again.
             <br><br>
I love the fact that Leonardo used his star-status to let more people be aware of the problems on other parts of the world.

There is a scene in Kevin Costner’s “Dances with Wolves” where the protagonist Lt. John Dunbar request to be stationed on the frontier wanting to see it before it disappears. This is now how I feel about the Arctic and the Amazon after watching “Before the Flood”. Our earth is slowing dying and the lives of my children will be vastly different from how things once were. I hope to see the Amazon and the Arctic before climate change takes its toll on them and they cease to be what they once were. This film addresses the problem of global warming and shows its effect on different places across the world until it ends with the signing of the Paris Climate Accords and leaves the audience hopeful. Watching this film post Donald Trump really takes away this optimism from the audience since we know the United States pulled out of this deal. I loved how this movie puts so much pressure on the American people to be the leaders of change as we are the most responsible. This personally motivated me to attempt to reduce my beef consumption and overall meat consumption. If the people of the world can zone out the corporate interest in the climate change debate and come together to rid the world of fossil fuels the Earth will remain the home of humanity.

“Before the Flood” is one of the few documentaries I have been able to sit through entirely and react to every idea that was mentioned. I admire every factor of this film, from the topics discussed to the visuals and featured speakers. I believe that every single person should watch this film and learn from it. Not only did it sum up the climate crisis and its consequences, but it collectively did so with moving videos and images, which serve as the proof that many people need to see to become aware and come to the realization of the climate crisis. 

             <br><br>

I admire the amount of  time dedicated in this film to the topic of political leaders that are in denial about the climate crisis. This angers me because apart from disregarding the biggest problem in our life right now, they are also discrediting the work that scientists do for us and dedicate their lives to. One statement that caught my attention was a man who said “Man can’t change climate”. This is not only discouraging to those who are taking action and doing what they can to contribute to the climate change movement, but it is also false. Not only is the current state of our earth due to anthropogenic climate change, but there are also people who refuse to acknowledge this. Thus, humans are both causing climate change and doing nothing to stop it. This not only shows selfishness but also the ineffective voting that takes place in some countries. This ineffective voting can be due to many things, one big factor being the lack of knowledge and encouragement of young generations. However, this can change by raising more awareness among young people all over the world, not just in one place. 

             <br><br>

Another factor that I like about this film is the interactions of DiCaprio with not only well known people but also with inhabitants of different places among the world that we often overlook. For example, in all honesty I can say that I never thought about how the climate crisis is affecting India or Japan. However, I now realize that different parts of the world are not only facing daily problems such as lack of electricity, but they also have to deal with the climate issues we are causing. 
             <br><br>
Also, I found it heartbreaking that people who live along coasts are being driven from their homes due to flooding of communities, making the climate crisis not only an environmental issue but also a national security issue. This helps put life into perspective because I now realize that even though the US thinks of itself as a  leader and world power, in reality we are an antagonist by not acting like an example for other countries and for our own inhabitants. 
             <br><br>


I enjoyed watching and learning from this documentary because of the visuals and the material it touches on. I also appreciate the hope that some speakers had and the encouragement they lent. Similar to the first assigned reading, we must realize the importance of educating the public at all costs, whether it be scaring people with the possible consequences or spending money on announcements. In my opinion, the most important part of this film is the critique of political figures and I think that problem remains today, so we must begin to act against it.

I thought it was interesting hearing the discussion about how the people who are against climate action know they don’t actually have to make a scientific argument, they just need to divide the public to foster hatred. This documentary made me think more about how we aren’t just unknowingly causing the climate crisis, and corporations are aware of it, they just don’t care. The public is being manipulated into believing climate activists are ignorant or even the “bad guys”, when greedy corporations are the ones creating these ideas to fill their own pockets and die before the climate crisis affects them. 
              <br><br>
Arguably the most interesting element of the film for me is how many people Leonardo DiCaprio interviews, especially the woman from India. Seeing the effects of the climate crisis on the lives of actual people made me feel even more panicked and saddened by the damage we have done. It was eye opening to actually see so many different parts of the earth that have been damaged, especially the coral reefs. When they mentioned that life will always exist in the oceans, it just might not be the life we want, I thought about how I have heard before that we aren’t killing the earth, we are making it kill us.

The film “ Before the Flood” was a film that I feel like everyone needs to watch. This film took us through a journey to make us realize that there is a climate crisis. Leonardo DiCaprio traveled all around the world to see how the changes in climate is affecting Earth. The results were melancholic, whenever Leonardo visited a new place we were introduced to a new problem they seemed never ending. This really made me think that change needs to happen fast. One scene that intrigued me was when, Indian environmentalist, Sunita Narain exposed the US. I did not know how bad the US was polluting our planet. Sunita did not hesitate to make Leonardo feel bad for the US and I also felt bad. She was not only talking to Leonardo but the whole US nation. I admire Sunita for her bravery and dedication to help keep our planet sustainable. We need more people like her, to not only worry about herself but to put other people in their place. Alas, I know that is very unrealistic. I just hope in the near future more actions are presented to help our planet.

In the film “An Inconvenient Sequel” Al Gore discusses the seriousness of climate change and his struggle to communicate and create change. He travels internationally giving a slideshow presentation about climate change and the consequences we are seeing and will see if nothing is done. He is quite influential and is respected around the world. During the Paris Climate Accords, he negotiated with countries, even though he was a private citizen and not an elected official. 
              <br><br>

He made his story relatable by discussing the struggles he has faced along the way. He openly said that he often gets discouraged by the lack of action of our country. This sentiment is felt by many environmentalists. However, he continues on even though he faces obstacles which left me with the feeling of hope.

In the film “Before the Flood,” Leonardo DiCaprio set out to different parts of the world to present to the audience (today’s living generations) aspects of the world that are impacted by the climate crisis. The film depicts the life of people whose homes are gone or in the stage of it, the negative impacts climate change has on agriculture, the warming climate, people’s responses to the crisis over time, etc. Overall, the film highlights the process of understanding and learning about how climate change is impacting the world, by seeing the varying ways it has changed the life of species and communities. Of this documentary, I particularly found important the presentation of valuing the perspectives of other people around the globe who are being impacted by climate change and those who have worked to tackle the issue. We can see perspectives when we see leaders of countries gathering in places like Paris to sign a deal and those of the inhabitants of countries  who have lost their homes. I feel like a lot was portrayed and learned from the documentary that at first might not be known to other people about the climate crisis. For instance, by watching this documentary I was able to learn about the Indonesian fires, that have swept 80% of the forests due to the Palm Oil industry. Furthermore, more places are introduced such as the islands in Kiribati, that are sinking due to sea level rises. In visiting these places, we learned about the loss of homes where people were once able to make a living. By looking at people's lives and circumstances in places like India, Indonesia, Greenland, and Miami, I was able to think and understand more about the subject. This was part of the learning experience, in learning about ways the crisis changes the life of others and how their can still be ways to solve the issue.

The film "Before the Flood" provides multiple perspectives on the climate crisis, drawing attention to the different places and aspects of life that are already being affected by climate change. DiCaprio addresses the impacts of global warming that aren't as obvious. Beyond sea level rise, thousands of animal species have already disappeared, as well as acres upon acres of forests. Political pursuits and corporate greed are two of the top contributors to the climate crisis, profiting off of the destruction of our planet and the suffering of millions of people worldwide, most commonly those in poor and developing communities. Profit is seen as more important than the future of every human being alive and unborn, sealing our fate to accumulate a vast fortune that the day to day person cannot avoid. Things like palm oil and meat consumption have been so ingrained into society that the average person in America cannot bring themselves to separate from them, especially when addressing their diets and daily habits. Yet going vegan is probably one of the most effective and easiest ways someone can contribute to the fight against the climate crisis, eliminating the amount of carbon entering the atmosphere as well as the need for 10+ animals devoted to a single meat-eating person. I really enjoyed this film because it not only points out the scary truth of climate change, it provides solutions and information on how we might be able to combat it.

In the film “Before the Flood”, I was shocked to find out that fossil fuel companies are covertly working behind the scenes to enforce the denial of climate change. To think of this sickens me, that a group of individuals would rather spend the time and resources to try to mislead the public about their impending doom, just so they can get wealthier in the process. Even worse, in turn, the fossil fuel sales that the companies profit from will contribute even more to climate change.  I feel that this just is the result of the capitalist machine that the United States has created. Capitalism is a system that demands infinite growth and consumption, and I feel that this is a major cause of the climate situation we are dealing with today. I feel that capitalism has been fueled too much, as companies are meddling our government to impose laws that favor them. For example, It is surprising that a carbon tax has not been introduced, as the film stated, as it would be a key tool to help restrict corporate emissions.

The film, "before the flood," is almost a process of taking Leonardo as the UN ambassador to visit the world to study the environment. The film actively explored the various effects brought about by global warming, and Leonardo personally visited the Arctic to witness the rapid melting of ice and snow, and Come to Beijing, India, Argentina, Italy, and other places to discuss the cooperation between energy use and government with people concerned about the environment. The 2015 Paris Energy Summit was an important step in the global effort to solve environmental problems together. As a film actor, Leonardo has the influence that he can take responsibility for exposing people to climate change and calling on people to act to protect the planet. If the problem caused by climate change cannot rise to the human point of view, only a few people or countries will fight alone, and the fragile planet will only be more vulnerable. Some statistics data shows in 2040, we will be able to sell on the North Pole. There is no sea ice left in the summer. We are burning so much fossil fuel so that the ice is melting. The arctic is like an air conditioner in the Northern Hemisphere. If the ice got away, that’s going to change the ocean current, the weather pattern, make the flood and drought more catastrophic. The ocean rises cause the cities submerged. In Miami, the politician has to raise tax revenue to build electronic pumps and raising the road. But these constructions can only protect people for 40 to 50 years. In China, people have concerns about climate change, but first and foremost because their everyday life is affected. People want to be part of the solution. However, in countries with large populations and slower development, such as India, having everyone have energy is no different from climate issues.  
              <br><br>

So, what do we do from ourselves? Originally, things like politics and capital cannot be changed by individual strength. We should implement environmental protection education on everyone and let people protect the environment spontaneously. It is up to all of us.

While watching “Before the Flood” I probably had the same question that everyone else had: why am I watching a 2 hour film of Leonardo DiCaprio talk about climate change. This made me realize the position DiCaprio puts himself in for us, the viewers, as a seemingly ignorant but environmentally curious person. This works really well because we are guided in this introductory adventure to scratch the surface of climate change. I think the film did the right idea to stay on “big picture” issues and ideas. There is no way that the audience would be able to learn the complexity of climate change in two hours, so DiCaprio retaining that informative narrative role really helped. It was as he said, “I’m no expert,” but his way of informing was done quite well.
              <br><br>


 I like the mix of pessimism and optimism in the film. We have some scientist saying that the effects of climate change are reversable, and others saying that we can prevent it from getting worse. Seeing this type of discourse really shows how even experts don’t exactly know the magnitude of the entire climate problem, which shows the magnitude of the situation and how serious it is. This may become an issue that is no longer under our control and the film does a good job of not scaring like Wallace’s article. The fear is there, but we are shown to still be in control (somewhat).

Before I watched the film “Before the Flood,” I was naive for believing that I knew everything I needed to know about climate change. I thought that by watching the news and listening in class that I had grasped enough knowledge on the subject of climate change to fully comprehend how we, as humans, are affecting the planet and what the results would be if we continued to follow along this path. Little did I know just how much humans truly impact climate change. Our economy is so dependent on fossil fuels that most people choose to live in denial and find ways to avoid facing the fact that anthropogenic climate change is real and is driven by greed. In the film, Leonardo Dicaprio travels around the globe and asks people in different places how their regions were being affected by climate change and how it is affecting them directly. This film is easy to relate to, because as he ventures to a new land and discovers how bad the consequences of climate change already are and how much worse they can get, we, the viewer, are learning with him how humans influence global warming. Leonardo Dicaprio was just as shocked as I was in certain parts of the film because of how much has already changed in the little time that we have become aware of global warming. However, regardless of the fact that the science behind climate change was so blatantly obvious in places such as the Canadian Arctic where the ice caps are melting and getting smaller, the film showed clips where new reporters chose to discredit Leonardo Dicaprio’s observations/research on climate change simply because he was “a hollywood actor with no scientific background.”
              <br><br>

It is not uncommon for politicians and larger companies to try to refute the climate change argument and their ignorant stance on this issue plays a large role in the climate crisis.They repeat over and over again that the climate crisis is a myth, that it is made up, that it is pure fiction, etc. even after scientific researchers and professionals provide models, graphs, charts, and predictions of how the earth is changing and will continue to change. They need the general public to believe that it is not true because they need to continue fracking and offshore drilling or else our economy will take a hit. Our country is money motivated and this is demonstrated by the fact that, despite all of the petitions and attempts to ban/ stop fracking and oil mining, large companies continue to use fossil fuels to supply their needs without taking into consideration how they are changing the lives of everyone who inhabits Earth. Politicians and companies like those believe they are entitled to destroy the lives of others just to make a profit and continue to expand their company/ political agenda. In the film, Dicaprio reveals that the real problem lies in our government. Therefore, if we elect officials who will support the public in movements that approach a way to combat climate change we will have a better chance of making environmental developments to save Earth.

The beginning of An Inconvenient Sequel is powerful, especially watching it today. Hearing all those voices disregarding climate change with such a passion knowing today how many species have already suffered and gone extinct and how in the future people of poor areas will suffer the most is extremely frustrating and infuriating. The example of Pakistan suffering high temperatures, reaching a heatwave that killed a thousand and two-hundred people is extremely saddening. Most of us in the U.S. cannot imagine the extremes of this heatwave. We can find airconditioning in our homes, stores, workplaces, and the so far. The U.S. contributes the most to the climate crisis and yet, the poor will suffer the most. 
              <br><br>

The existence now of rain bombs is frightening; the water splashes as if it was a rainfall. Farms are being lost due to drought; that shows how the food supply could and will be affected. I found “couldn’t you hear what mother nature was screaming at you” a POWERFUL question. This film does an excellent job of evoking an urge to want to make a change and difference. I enjoy the empathy presented to both the Earth and the people who are being affected. This is an amazing sequel I very much hope many see.

The film An Inconvenient Sequel showed the audience why they should follow what Al Gore is preaching. He tells the audience how the melting icebergs in Greenland are leading to floods in Florida and how eventually they will not be able to stop them. He shows them how increasing warm temperatures will lead to stronger hurricanes and increase flooding everywhere. It is all these rich corporations putting all these fossil fuels into our atmosphere but it is the poor people that will experience the brute force of climate change.

              <br><br>

Many people try to stop efforts Al Gore’s effort by claiming that days are still getting cool and therefore climate change is not real. However Gore fights that claim by showing how while there are cooling periods,  the periods of high temperature are increasing. It is these very people that make the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy very difficult. In Florida the ability is put solar panels is prohibited. But how can the government prohibit your right to leave your children a habitable planet? 
              <br><br>

A feel like the difference between this film and Before the Flood is that this film is not only looking at the devastation of Climate Change but is actively working on present day solutions as well as future ones. Al Gore was able to get India on board with the Paris agreement by making renewable energy more accessible. Furthermore, he is training people to become leaders in climate change and continue the fight long after he is gone.

The film “Before the flood” was extremely interesting and eye-opening. This documentary focuses specifically on how manmade emissions are negatively effecting our planet now, and serves as a warning sign of dangers to come unless we take action. This film does not necessarily focus on numbers and science based information but rather the shocking statistics which really put into perspective how grave the consequences of climate change are. Discussing how In the end, the Earth can continue to live on without the human race, but without the Earth, humankind will eventually meet its demise. As the climate crisis is progressing at an unprecedented rate, questions are being raised as to what the future will hold if there is no solution within the next few years. In the last decade, global average temperatures have been the highest ever recorded. Antarctica, Greenland, and the Arctic are losing billions of tons of ice and coastlines are being consumed by rising sea levels. An increase in anthropogenic human activity has lead to higher sea surface temperatures which in turn culminate intense weather patterns. Hurricanes, floods, droughts, storms, and heat waves are just the beginning. The fate of the climate crisis rests in humankind's hands depending on what happens within the next couple decades. The film Before the flood features an impressive amount of celebrities which at first made me a little skeptical considering there could be other motives behind this film, but in the end, I was pleasantly surprised with how well Leonardo DiCaprio played his role as the protagonist. Overall, this film did a great job of visualizing the climate crisis rather than just speaking statistics at the audience and had an impact on me and hopefully everyone who watches it.

In the film, "Before the Flood" their audience explores the severity of the climate crisis alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. He travels around the world and we witness the destruction that is being caused by climate change. Something that really stood out to me in the film was how a scientist was attacked for publishing data that supported climate change. He even got death threats. It's crazy to me how people don't realize that the weather conditions we are currently experiencing are not normal and are early signs of what is to come. Although, the film does touch up on why people specifically in the United States are ignorant to the this issue, which has to do a lot with politics. Politicians are bribed by big corporations and deny that climate change is real because they benefit from the fossil fuels these corporations are putting out to the world. Some of the places he travels to are China, India, Greenland, Abaiang, Argentina, Indonesia etc.The people of China have been fighting for renewable energy and they are moving in that direction; although they do still continue to use fossil fuels. Some scientists are optimistic about the future and believe that we can turn this around if people start to pay attention and change the ways in which they consume. The woman in the film that was from India explains the hypocrisy of the United States as they say that India is making the same mistakes that they have made in the past by burning their energy but yet Americans are one of the biggest consumers and thus are huge contributors to the climate crisis. The film also discusses the consequences that are going to come with the heating of the earth like the disappearance of Greenland. They also point out how the countries that are already being affected by this climate change and sea level rise are poor countries. Another thing that really stuck with me was how we are destroying what we need to help us with the warming of the earth like the Oceans and Rainforests. Rainforests are being intentionally set on fire to make profits on oils and due to the meat industry.

The film, "Before the Flood" shows the audience a visual of climate change, or the climate crisis.  It shows how it is happening and how it is affecting the environment and everything around.  I found the film very interesting in that it showed in detail, the climate crisis.  It also gives possible solutions on how we can stop this before it gets any further.  It is very interesting the way the film goes around the globe in order to actually show the devastating impacts of climate change.  One obvious but important impact is the melting of the polar caps.  This has already began and it seems very inevitable.  If it indeed happens then the sea level will rise causing catastrophe across.  One thing the film does that articles might not do is, it visually describes the science behind it all. To the public it may be unclear why greenhouse gases, fracking, or the exposure of fossil fuels causes the climate crisis.  In many articles it explains this concept but it may still be too confusing.  The film does a very good job in that it visually shows how and why the climate crisis is happening and why we need to stop fracking, and exposing more fossil fuels that are deep underground not causing any harm.  Although the facts are there, people choose to ignore it and continue to release excess CO2 and continue to frack, and expose fossil fuels releasing even more CO2, then go on to burn the fossil fuel into energy causing CO2 once again.  In order for us to deal with the problem at front we have to cut down on these things because if we do not then it will have devastating results.

Before watching the film “Before the Flood” I had not really heard of Leonardo DiCaprio as an environmentalist or of his role as an ambassador to the United Nations for climate change and peace. So I was very surprised when I found out he would be narrating the film and just how much he knew and has done to help educate the public as well as being the United Nations ambassador for climate change. The way the film was structured I feel it was very smart that the audience went on this journey with Leo and learned from many different experts and saw first hand the consequences that are already happening. Knowing that all it takes is a carbon tax for the United States public to move away from fossil fuels is astounding and knowing that our government’s politicians are in the pockets and under the influence of fossil fuel companies and that is what is stopping the government from taking immediate action angers me as a young adult who will feel the effects of climate change as I age. 
              <br><br>

I also feel similar to DiCaprio in the sense that I am more pessimistic on the subject of the climate crisis. In the film, DiCaprio discusses that scientists and politicians have known about climate change for decades but still the country has done nothing to lower its emissions or even put laws into place that can help combat our use of fossil fuels. One aspect of the documentary that I admire very much is it showed that every person on the planets does not carry the weight of climate change equally. When DiCaprio was talking to Sunita Narain and how she was saying that the people who are emitting more are people from the United States but people from poorer countries like those in Africa or India are barring the consequences when they shouldn’t. Once I finished the film I felt equal parts pessimistic and optimistic, which I know is contradictory but I was able to see both sides in the sense that I feel like the public will not be able to change in time before climate change will become irreversible. Then at the same time, I know that technology is always changing and people like Greta Thunberg become huge activists and components that could help get enough people educated and slightly scared about the topic of the climate crisis.

The documentary “Before the Flood” by National Geographic, featuring famous actor Leonardo DiCaprio is, in my opinion, one of the most well put documentaries I have ever seen. I found it very interesting that Leonardo DiCaprio talked to numerous global leaders in five continents on global warming instead of staying solely in the United States. It draws more credibility on the individual impacts of global warming on each region since representatives from those areas are being interviewed directly. The documentary really felt like a great platform where everyone could contribute their knowledge about how climate change was affecting them personally. In my opinion, this allows the documentary to really reflect the ideals of political leaders and activists worldwide on the problem at hand. Professor Ken’s question in this video, “If you could know the truth about the climate crisis would you want to know?” is a perfect segway into the documentary which sought the truth from a global problem by gathering knowledge from people around the world. What I liked the most about the documentary is that Leonardo was perfect for the role of a passionate environmental activist. Once I learned he is an activist for climate change by choice and even chooses to remain vegan to avoid contributing to the greenhouse gas production of the beef industry, his affection for the environment felt so much more genuine and it made sense why National Geographic would choose him to star in the documentary. What Leonardo DiCaprio represents is that chance for viewers to comprehend how global warming has affected people and ecosystems worldwide and what happens if we let it continue at the rate it’s been growing.
              <br><br>


On a side note, I do wish the documentary specified more about how individuals back home could contribute toward reducing atmospheric greenhouse gases. I believe that global warming is such a big issue that people need to be given individual tasks they can do to help contribute back to society. Otherwise, people may feel alone and their efforts futile in comparison to the weight of the issue at hand.

Before the Flood. DiCaprio wondering if he is the right guy to be the UN ambassador is exactly the scepticism that characterises a good documentary/movie. Without healthy criticism about the subject you are passionate about you take the risk that your message becomes one-sided and dull. This is not the case in before the flood. It is not only a advocate for taking the climate change seriously but at the same time takes the time to explain exactly wha it is that should change. Adding in Leonardo gives it the personal touch that helps viewers emphasise with the stance that is taken. Although it is not pleasant to hear that many of our daily activities are contributing to the Climate crisis, it is however extremely necessary that we do get an insight in what is happening right under our noses. The way this documentary is structured it appeals to a sense of familiarity by bringing us the faces we already know lik Elon Musk, Obama and of course Leonardo DiCaprio. As a COMM major I love the way this documentary nudges you in the right direction while still being fairly urgent (Lets be honest it is called Before the Flood). I have not yet found the time to watch the other documentaries and movies but I am looking forward to doing so during this course.

Comment on Before the Flood:
              <br><br>

Special Interests.
              <br><br>

These two words stand out to me the most as I watched before the flood.
              <br><br>
It is absolutely terrifying and disheartening that our planet is being ruined in order to benefit just a few, and the lengths that these corporate leaders and politicians would go to to misinform the public in order to protect their wealth and special interests, which includes discrediting and threatening the lives of scientists, who make the protection of our planet their life mission.
              <br><br>

It is also ridiculous how American engineers suggests that countries like India move towards solar energy when even their own country (the unites states) can't even do that themselves. The conflict between the climate crisis and energy access remains an ethical conundrum. How can we ask countries like India to move towards solar when 300 millions of their people do not have access to electricity and the cheapest source of energy available is coal? And who will be willing to invest in solar energy to make it cheaper?
              <br><br>

One idea that really connects with me is the carbon tax. Understandably, it is very hard for people to go through their day to day lives and always keeping in mind "What kind of decision I will make to save our planet?" It seems too big of a problem for one person to think about that they may give up altogether. But with the tax enforce, people will be more aware of their spending and in the long run. That will have a big impact on our environment.

Before the flood is a spectacular documentary showing the climate change problem. It is also informative, authoritative, and interesting to follow. I have learned many new things by watching this film. Climate change is not only about global warming, but it is truly the modification to the climate pattern. To explain that, we should first understand that the climate is different from the weather. Climate is the long-term pattern of weather. We could argue that someday the weather seems good and there is no problem in it, but we can’t draw a conclusion from an odd period and say that the climate isn’t changing. What DiCaprio wants us to know is this misconception set up deliberately by the large enterprises in the energy market. Climate change is not only increasing temperature, but it also has huge impacts on different regions in the world. We could see droughts near the equators and Alabama; we could also see sea level rises in Miami; but oddly, we could also see colder climate pattern in Europe because global warming melts up the ice cap and water follows down to the ocean, cutting up a current from the Atlantic ocean that brings heat to Europe. 
              <br><br>


All of this would then cause substantial changes to the world. The situation now may not look like urgency and may not be so obvious but when it comes to being clear, the effects are catastrophic. As President Obama says, climate change is not only an environmental issue but a national security issue. I can see some points related to this topic in this film. There are people living in Kiribati, near the west Pacific, who are moving to other places in Europe due to sea level rises. The scientific forecasts show evidence that their islands will sink in the future. Even more dramatically, the taxes collected by the government of Kiribati are not used in building dams, and pipes to resist the effects of sea-level rise. Instead, the president uses them to buy lands in Europe and encourage citizens to move there as immigrants. How sad it is to hear a story that climate changes are taking homes away from people and forcing them to migrate. What comes next has to do with the capacity of the western countries on accepting immigrants. What if they stop receiving “climate refugees” in the future because their resources are not enough to support more population? What will then happen to those people and the order of the world? There will definitely be wars for resources. As we can see in the middle east where water, land, and resources are scarce, countries are fighting for more lands for agriculture and more water to sustain their population. Climate change has aggravated this conflict and increased the number of wars in the middle east. 

              <br><br>

It is then reasonable to say that we, humanity, should work collectively to solve the problems of climate change. But the situation is very complicated. There is resistance from large energy enterprises who are unwilling to change the cheap energy sources like coal, oil and natural gas to much more expensive renewable energy like solar, wind and tidal; there is scientific evidence showing that the change is partially irreversible; there are countries which are not willing to invest too much money into developing renewable energy sources; there are people who can’t live without beef and not willing to change while understanding that pasture creates large amount of CH4 and this is an extremely harmful greenhouse gas; there are many complicated issues in culture, economy, society, and perception, leading to the slow development in addressing climate change. I have to link back to DiCaprio at the beginning of the film, where he feels pessimistic about the future. I start to understand why he will have that feeling. We can’t get back to the first picture of Eden’s garden where human lives peacefully with the planet. It will be a shame on us if we don’t start to make a change. As DiCaprio mentions in his speech to the UN committees, we will either be praised as a hero for addressing climate change or as criminals by our descendants for not taking actions. It is fair enough to say that the future of this planet depends on us and there is no reason for not taking action, even as one little thing as changing the diet to have less meat or substitutes to beef like pork and chicken. We need to start now.

"Before the Flood" is one of many documentaries regarding climate crisis that underlines the need of change in our current lifestyle and life in general. After watching the film, I observed how people ignore the scientific data and changes to the weather and consider the whole situation as a hoax.  Throughout the movie, Leonardo Dicaprio's travels the world to fully experience the affected environments with different activists. The film tries to use his fame and popularity and with him in the center, it offers current and crucial information to bring forth the attention to the problems of global warming. Climate change is a worldwide and growing issue, but under America's political system and corruption, the United States' climate adaption and mitigation strategies have been suppressed. While problems continue to expand, there are many solutions that have already begun carried out, such as eating less beef, which reduces the amount of methane gas they emit. The power is in our hands and is a matter of how we use it to bring forth change for our home.

<p>
Before the Flood faces and tackles a daunting task: to shift focus from the specifics of climate change to the big picture problem. The film makes a point to emphasize that solving the issue of climate change can no longer be a small-scale solution, focused on the things that individuals can do, such as “changing a lightbulb”. The film has a notably more pessimistic, grim take on the individual’s role and ability in preserving the climate due to Dicaprio’s growing sense of scope concerning the climate crisis. Dicaprio states that in the 2000s, the main method of confronting the climate crisis was to raise public awareness of the issue and encourage individuals to make easy, small switches to more eco-friendly lifestyle choices. This film stands in stark contrast to this method, instead opting to display to the viewer the horrifically massive scope of the problem: Dicaprio is a pessimist because, through learning more about the climate crisis, he and the viewer realize that no individual or even group of individuals can reverse the damage the entire human race has done over hundreds of years. It is made clear that the target for a real impact in preserving the climate must be large-scale fossil fuel companies, all of which systematically and knowingly destroy the environment and silence all cries of climate destruction. The individual’s role, then, must be to approach the climate crisis problem from a political view: the individual must exert any and all political power and sway to work together with the public to force large-scale change. The climate crisis must be fought together.
              <br><br>


The film also handles the issue of climate change deniers and Dicaprio haters with a tongue firmly in cheek. The film, far from ignoring the issue of casting an actor that has no expertise in climate science to speak for climate change, brings to the spotlight the fact that Dicaprio knows little about the climate crisis, despite being an environmental spokesperson and symbol. This fact doesn’t detract from the credibility of the film’s point, however, as it is made clear that Dicaprio is not meant to be an authority on climate change and does not need to be one in order to do whatever he can to fight for action on climate change. Just as Dicaprio is not a climate scientist, so too is the ordinary person whose action and support is NEEDED for change not a climate scientist. The film asserts that every single person, knowledgeable or not on the subject of climate change, MUST care and MUST act in order to save our planet. Dicaprio, then, serves as the perfect spokesperson for the climate crisis, because if an actor can fight to save the environment, so too can a firefighter, or coder, or teacher, or cashier, or salesperson, or business manager - so too can everyone.

The filmmaker's approach to informing the audience about climate change is a very clever rhetorical device. Using a well known face to act as a buffer allows the audience to receive these harsh truths with a much more open mind. Even better, Leonardo DiCaprio has been an environmental activist for the past couple of decades, even becoming an United Nations Climate Ambassador. This voluntary action demonstrates to the audience that this is a cause worth taking action in, because climate change truly affects everyone.  

              <br><br>

I admire the film’s wide range of climate change issues, from the business giants behind palm oil to the everyday streets of smog-ridden China. The film follows the everyday stories of normal people struggling to combat this issue, yet also presents interviews with important figures such as the Pope. By doing so, it conveys how huge of an issue climate change really is. What connected with me the most was how any major legislative change started from the people, not the political leaders. As stated in the documentary, it was the actions of consumers and voters that led same sex marriages to be legalized in the United States. Similarly here, people across the world are protesting, and creating an increased public awareness of the climate crisis.



</p><hr>


<p>
In the film “Before the Floods”, it is mentioned that the influence of climate change is not merely the rising sea levels but a chain-reacting destruction.They supported this by giving an example of the occurences in Greenland, which is already melting and self-heating. Such facts really spread fears and foretells people’s future if we do not take actions from now on. 
              <br><br>

Besides, DiCaprio also introduces some famous world figures who have placed incredible influences in pushing forward the movement towards change. Although he was not a scientist or politician, he could also use his own way to enact changes, and this can attract and persuade more people to get involved in the movements. Under the influence of DiCaprio, they can start from participating in raising the awareness of their friends and families and paying more attention to sustainability. The film ended with some suggestions offered to the public about what people can do to help, including alternating our consumption patterns, participating in votes, and adding carbon taxes.

In An Inconvenient Sequel it is incredibly evident that Al Gore is dedicated to making a difference in the policies that affect climate crisis. Gore has been an advocate for our planet for decades and has poured his efforts into creating climate leadership trainings all around the world that show people the realities of climate change and demonstrate how they can help. This film is especially effective at getting people to take an interest in climate change because it appeals to both a logical side and a more emotional side. With interviews from survivors of natural disasters and footage from people suffering at the hand of extreme weather events, An Inconvenient Sequel causes people to consider how they would feel if they were to lose a loved one to a natural disaster brought on by anthropogenic climate change. The film does not rely solely on an emotional response from its viewers but instead strengthens the argument by including several charts with easy to understand data that demonstrates its sound research and credibility.
              <br><br>


An Inconvenient Sequel shows the reality of the politics surrounding climate change and how complicated these agreements between nations can be. For example, after the Paris Agreement gave us some hope that we could actually come together to make a real difference on a global level a new president took office and extinguished that spark of hope. It can be incredibly frustrating to see all of the political barriers that stop us from being able to change the bleak future that will result from the continued denial of climate change. Denial is not the only challenge that faces politics as An Inconvenient Sequel demonstrates when Gore met with a representative from India. Even when leaders in less developed countries believe in climate change they tend to have a hard time doing anything to stop it because they face financial challenges in doing so. 

              <br><br>

Both Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio are extremely well known for incredibly different reasons but in each case this popularity is an advantage for drawing in a large audience for their films. It is encouraging to see more influential people using their fame for such a worthy cause as climate change because they are speaking for all the people that are not being heard. Before the Flood is an important film because DiCaprio’s fame is likely to attract an audience that was originally only interested due to his appearance in the film and will then inform them about the important issue of the climate crisis. An issue that Before the Flood could face is judgment from climate deniers who will claim that because DiCaprio is an actor he does not have credibility and his film should not be taken seriously. Al Gore also faces scrutiny when speaking about climate change due to his prior experiences as a politician. This criticism is seen in the beginning of the film when audio clips of various criticisms about Gore played in the background. An Inconvenient Sequel would be more likely to attract an audience made up of people already interested in the climate crisis and particularly the politics involved. The diverse range of films available that discuss climate change is something that allows me to feel a small sense of hope that the majority of people will see at least one film that informs them about this threat and its severity.

I took English 22 before this course and watched nine or ten films in that course. This is the first film from this course series that made me cry. During the flood footage and listening to a survivor speak about the true and deep terror he felt shook me. Seeing the footage of Syria and hearing Gore phrase it as their world going up in chaos, innocent lives being lost, and complete devestations and then them looking at us, living comfortably thanks to our fossil fuel addiction and screaming “couldn't you listen to the scientists and mother nature?!” got me as well. I had never heard it phrased like that. That also ties in to the meeting with the Indian representative where he makes the point that fingers are being pointed to third world countries who are using the resources to help industrialize and update their lifestyles to have their citizens have access to basic human needs while we have had our turn for 150 years. It's not fair at all and this film shone a new light on the inequality that the climate crisis brings. This film was very effective in appealing to its audiences emotions using tough footage to watch from very recent and fresh events such as the terror attacks in France. I cried during the natural disasters and then again when the Paris Accord was signed. This film was a good balance of scaring its audience and giving a good amount of hope for the future if we all make an effort. I loved this film and will recommend it to all my friends and family.

The film, "An Inconvenient Sequel," reminded me of many aspects of Leonardo DiCaprio's film "Before the Flood." Both Al Gore and DiCaprio ventured throughout the United States and in different countries to get different perspectives from people experiencing different aspects of the climate crisis. DiCaprio and Gore care deeply about the effects innocent people are facing with this crisis and try to find achievable solutions. The development of India is a tough situation for both because of the fact that they are only following in the United State's footsteps, and Al Gore prevails at the Paris Agreement by giving help to India to sway them in fighting the crisis, not adding more to it. 
              <br><br>
Al Gore did get more opportunities to dive deeper into the topic and meet other leaders because of his political experience as senator and Vice President which helps him gain the knowledge to provide solutions that help everyone, without experience of being a scientist. Gore does acknowledge the privilege the US has and he adds it to his passion to help educate pioneers in this climate crisis movement so they can go out and lead the world to wake up and change our ways of life. We have a responsibility to help other countries because we have the technology and we won't survive this unless we fight together. When Al Gore went to Texas to meet the republican mayor of Georgetown, I was shocked to see how involved and excited he was to be the largest city in the US to use 100% renewable energy. Conservative views and climate change don't usually go together and to see that he understood it was common sense that polluting the air was bad, it made me think about what is really holding people back from caring about our earth. Money is too influential for humans and it's sad that we want it more than a clean earth. The mayor from Texas really is setting the bar and helps to make people think about different things that cause pollution and why we should stop it for the conservative points of view. He is helping to change the game. 
              <br><br>
This film did make me quite emotional at some points, especially when it showed people digging mass graves in preparation for natural disaster. The hurricane and flood videos make me feel so sympathetic for the innocent people that are going through these disasters because there is no immediate change that can stop all of it. This film made me think about how my future will turn out if nothing is done to protect the earth, and I will admit it is a bit discouraging. People like Al Gore, Leonardo DiCaprio, and even the mayor from Texas continue to give me the hope that we can still fight and stop the need for people to prepare for mass deaths because of the climate crisis. Al Gore has ignited the passion even more.

Before the Flood:               <br><br>

I have always thought of myself as reasonably well informed on climate change and its broad effects on all life. I saw/see climate change mentioned constantly in articles and on the news and, though I was concerned about how these drastic changes would be managed in the future, I had lost some of the alarm that I had held when I was first introduced to the reality of climate change. The constant barrage of the horrors of climate change had numbed me into a state of constant but mild fear for our future. However, watching “Before the Flood” reinvigorated my views on climate change. I was fascinated by how the film successfully managed to show the wide variety of negative effects climate change has on all ecosystems and the negative feedback loops that occur when one change occurs. For instance, at one point the film discussed how increases in temperatures (from increased CO2 in the atmosphere) have caused an increase in wildfires. These fires then release enormous amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere as plants burn which further increases temperatures creating a higher potential for these wildfires. This made me think of the current fires in Australia and all the damage it is causing to the land and wildlife. It is disheartening to think that while wildfires occur naturally, their prevalence has increased due to human behavior. The film also describes how weather changes have and will continue to devastate life on earth, both human and animal. As the ice at the poles melt sea levels rise causing flooding that will eventually eat up the coasts of certain areas (the film discussed how Florida has already had to take action to deal with this flooding). In addition, because temperatures are rising weather and storms have will continue to grow in strength and frequency. Despite this, people continue to fight against measures that would combat climate change, refusing to see how detrimental a lack of action is. “Before the Flood” clearly shows why denying climate change cannot be an option. Its wide scope on the different effects of climate change makes it an excellent movie to show to those who think inaction is acceptable as it gives evidence to why the opposite is true.

After watching the film "Before the Flood" narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio; it is easy to say that the world is deteriorating due to climate change. This documentary acts as a call to action for its viewers to focus on a lifestyle in which CO2 emissions are lower than what they are now. I believe the world is capable of reducing CO2 emissions but only at a high cost.

<br><br>
Much of the world's people and its industries depend on fossil fuels. With natural gas and coal as the backbone for the production of household energy and current renewable energy sources being very costly, we are stuck in a period where technology must evolve and become more cost-efficient to the everyday person. As we move to a more advanced age though; in which our solar panels charge our electric cars every night  I believe we will be able to combat the rising CO2 levels but not reverse the damage that has already been done.



</p><hr>


<p>
After watching “Before the Flood”, it is clear that it gives a clear understanding of the dangerous effects that climate change will bring upon us and the Earth. One petrifying example that showcases how this climate crisis is affecting the Earth is the melting glaciers and ice sheets. I find it alarming the rate at which the Greenland Ice sheet, for example, has been melting over time. This is critical to our survival because it helps keep our planet cool and habitable by refracting heat back into space.
 <br><br>
If these glaciers and ice sheets continue to melt, the oceans will become warmer thus taking in more heat from the sun. The content of the movie is overall appealing to everyone because it talks about the many disasters that are occuring around the globe like the floods in Florida. It is sad to see how we made this happen within a single lifetime. This movie was appealing to me because not only does it inform us about the many disasters, but also gives suggestions on what we can do to help better the problem.

"An Inconvenient Sequel" follows Al Gore digging into the frustrating politics and portrayal of climate change in the media. One of the most compelling clips to me was the media calling certain aspects of climate change incredibly improbable or ridiculous, such as the flooding of the Twin Towers memorial in New York, followed by a news clip describing said incident actually happening. It puts it into startling perspective that the devastating things we're reading about now are going to come to fruition if nothing is done about the climate crisis very soon. 
 <br><br>
This point follows into another very compelling part of the documentary, the Pakistani mass grave digging to prepare for heat deaths. Having just read "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells which details all the deaths that the heat of climate change will cause, then to see that played out in "An Inconvenient Sequel", is sickening to say the least. 
 <br><br>
By the end of the film, I felt very attached to Gore and his journey of education. More so than I felt compelled watching Leonardo DiCaprio in "Before the Flood". I felt sympathy for Gore having been an ignored proponent for this cause for so long, having his satellite launch cancelled. I was personally more emotionally engaging than DiCaprio's approach of "playing down his knowledge" to be taught through the film.

<p>
The film, "Before the Flood", surprised me, not only through the information it gives out, but through its cast as well. Leonardo Decaprio was someone I did not know was involved in environmental sciences and climate issues. However his performance in this film has solidified my respect for him as an actor and activist. I found the journey he took us on around the world, highlighting the ways climate change has affected our communities already, to be exciting and informative. Rising sea temperatures are causing numerous problems around our world (melting glaciers and leveled forests). Climate change is truly a global issue void of biased political standingSimilar to how the article, "The Uninhabitable Earth", by David Wallace-Wells provides shocking information to his audience, "Before the Flood" informed me of the dangers to come with climate change. 
 <br><br>


To effectively fight climate change, we can't rely only on our improvements in technology (electric cars, renewable energy). This is because, while they're great, they don't make a big enough change for us to completely and solely rely on them. A truly impactful change we can make as individuals involves a change to a mainly plant-based diet. Our meat industries are responsible for a very large part of the CO2 released into our atmosphere.

 <br><br>

I feel as though films like this are very important for spreading general awareness of the problem to all age demographics. As more and more people gain knowledge of the issue at hand, we can start to really combat climate change.



</p><hr>


<p>
“Before the Flood” is a film that addressed climate issues we as a species have brought about but more importantly emphasizes the role politics is playing in our inaction and ignorance to these issues. I was personally angered by much of the misinformation spread by politicians presented in the film. It is extremely frightening to know that the wealth generated by fossil fuel companies is poured into spreading such misinformation to the public and keeping our government from implementing the environmental policies we are in desperate need of. Many may argue that Leonardo DiCaprio is a Hollywood actor who is not qualified enough to speak on such issues, but one could argue the same for politicians with no scientific background who are denouncing what climatologists are saying.
 <br><br>

I applaud DiCaprio for using his platform to spread environmental information, as few other celebrities go to such lengths to stand up for what they believe in. It is important that all of the American public, and even the global population, believe in scientific findings and understand that those denouncing climate change are backed heavily by the companies that are causing it. As addressed in the documentary, politicians sway their policies in favor of what the American people want. If the environment was not such a split issue, I fully believe that drastic policies to combat climate change would have been put in place years ago.

After watching "Before the Flood", I too was in shock and disgusted by the reminder of how influential and powerful the upper class is. I agree the injustice of misinformation is angering and frightening and puts into question the productivity of our democracy since money has such an influential hand in both politics and 'scientific' research. I really like your point about the hypocrisy of politicians denouncing climate change with no scientific background and then criticizing other people for having no scientific background. Something additionally to look at is the fact that Leonardo Dicaprio has nothing to gain by being an activist. Dicaprio already has fame and money, while politicians do have something to gain. 
 <br><br>

I agree that DiCaprio using his resources to bring awareness to this crisis is applauded and I hope it will encourage other influential people to do the same. The sources of scientific findings are crucial and people need to be more interested in the funding and backing of reports. Having celebrities or people of influence remind the public of this reality is a step in the right direction and can assist in shifting the public perspective. The public perspective is what can sway politicians and governmental policies.

Out of all of the environmental documentaries I have watched, “Before the Flood” seemed to have the highest budget and be a little more polished. Having Leonardo DiCaprio narrate this as the UN Messenger of Peace has an important message regarding the climate crisis for all viewers; no one, not even movie stars, should be ignoring the reality of climate change. Having someone with as big of a name as DiCaprio also increases exposure which in itself makes the film an effective tool at getting more people to become aware of climate change.
 <br><br>
The film does a good job at giving a rudimentary explanation of the greenhouse effect with high quality graphics and animations. In addition, I like how the film had segments involving a variety of climate scientists and other important people like former president Barack Obama and Elon Musk. It placed emphasis on the evidence and science that most of the world accepts to be true about climate change as well as proposing solutions both having to do with politics and technological advancements.
 <br><br>
While sort of expected with these more popular documentaries, I had some issues with some of the claims being made that weren’t really backed by evidence. At one-point DiCaprio relates the situation back to himself as he explains while filming one of the movies that all the snow was melting, and they had to fly the crew halfway across the world to find the “last remaining snow.” While a huge implication of climate change is more intense and extreme weather events, this example seemed like a bit of a reach and made the film a little less impressive to me. Overall, though, I liked the film and think it is an important tool in communicating the evidence and importance of climate change to the masses.

Before the Floodby Leonardo DiCaprio refreshes my understanding of climate change and evokes me to reflect on this issue. This film includes Leonardo’s talk with a variety of people closely relevant to the issue, rendering the film full of meaningful insights into the issue and providing the audiences a rather comprehensive picture of the global issue from various perspectives.
  <br><br>

There are several unforgettable and impressive parts of the film. The first part is Leonardo’s talk with Sunita Narain, who provides insights on global climate change from India’s perspective. Her sayings about how the US can be an impactful leader in transforming into sustainable development but has done so is incisive. I was also surprised by how “half year’s rainfall came in 5 hours and destroyed farmers’ long-term efforts”. Most importantly, Sunita’s argument for the problem of insufficient electricity supply against the request they faced of having more renewable energy is a critical social problem that evokes my thoughts – are the goals of satisfying people’s basic needs and pursuit of sustainability conflicted? What are some ways to find the balance? What can the world do to realize that balance? 
  <br><br>

Along the film, one sentence I love the most and made me moved is one sentence said by Doctor Piers Sellers. He said that he was approaching the end of his life but was still holding optimism about the planet. He said: “I really do have faith in people, and I think that once people come out of the fog of confusion on an issue, or uncertainty of an issue, and realistically appreciate it, at some level, the threat, and they’re informed of what’s the best action to deal with it, they got on and did it. And what seemed like almost impossible to deal with, you know, became possible.” I think this sentence not only applies to the issue of climate crisis, but also to most difficulties we face in our life. This attitude, especially in the circumstance of Piers, really aspires me. 
  <br><br>

The third shocking moment I had when I was watching the film is the part featuring Sumatra forest, where a lot of forest were cut for farming palm oil. The poor diverse animals that once inhabit in the forest really appeal to me and evoke my compassion and anger. To mitigate such tragedy, we can start action by buying less. This, again, emphasizes the concept I learnt in my environmental economics class that “We are all farmers.” If we could change our lifestyles by a bit, such as reducing our use and demand for palm oils, we may have saved a piece of forests that absorbs what we emit (CO2) and gives what we need (O2), which is so important for the harmony between human and nature and the sustainability of our planet Earth.
  <br><br>

This film triggers me to associate our planet Earth with an individual human being, as they are both independent dynamic systems. I think to sustainably develop is like to take care of our health, and to solely develop economically regardless of the environment is like to work or study with one’s sacrifice of physical health. 
  <br><br>

Lastly, I want to add that initially, I had some sorts of bad impression about the film because Leonardo travelled so many places, using a variety of vehicles such as airplane, cars, and submarines that are very carbon intensive. While I understand certain traveling are necessary to reveal certain environmental circumstances authentically and vividly, some shots could probably be referenced from other recorders or resources to reduce the journey’s carbon footprint.

The film “Before the Flood” is an intriguing inquiry into the reality of the climate crisis, from the perspective of the well-known Leonardo Dicaprio. I was surprised to learn that Dicaprio was not only a climate activist, but was selected as the UN messenger of peace. While many people have criticized him for not being a climate expert, I think there is something to admire about Dicaprio for not only using his platform to speak up about important issues, but for acknowledging his shortcomings and actively seeking to change. From the beginning of the film through the end, he recognizes that what the critics have said is true: he is no scientist and his carbon footprint is definitely larger than most of ours. However, he makes the choice to learn from experts and seek ways to help the issue. I think using Dicaprio as the narrator of the movie was an effective rhetorical strategy that served to gain empathy from the audience by telling the story from a perspective similar to ours. Dicaprio seeked answers from various sources, each one adding valuable information to answer the question of the climate crisis. Personally, I found the interview with Sunita Narain particularly influential. When asked about India’s efforts, she argued that energy access is as important an issue as climate change in India. She urges Dicaprio, and the whole of Americans to see the issue from a sociological perspective, and to realize that switching to solar or renewable energy isn’t a practical solution for them. I found Sunita’s words to be extremely powerful since she brought up the truth of the situation that no one likes to hear: we are a “fossil addicted country”, yet it isn’t us who will suffer the most from our actions, but the poor who are already dealing with the consequences.

Bringing the issue of climate crisis to a much more personal view, Leonardo DiCaprio embodies the viewer and their curiosities regarding the dire issues of this topic. Unlike most other documentaries, I was very engaged seeing DiCaprio go on this journey that I obviously couldn't, as these issues felt much more personal in comparison to simply reading articles. Interviewing and talking to these great world leaders and scientists in person, there was a new sense of credibility, as well, given to these obviously knowledgeable people, for it can often be difficult to truly understand the scope of how much these people know from just reading their work.

  <br><br>

Regarding the actual issues that DiCaprio addressed, it was frightening learning the mass amount of people and resources being devoted towards denying and furthering the problem of the climate crisis. I hadn't realized that oil companies are actually counter funding climate crisis relief groups, trying to refute that our planet is in any harm. The title's reference to the "flood" of climate crisis consequences that is to come if we don't do anything is becoming much less of metaphor and more of a reality, as much of the population is being subject to faulty persuasion that there is in fact no problem at all.



</p><hr>


<p>
I was surprised at first when I found out that Leonardo DiCaprio is so involved in the advocacy and preservation of our planet. I find it extremely noble that he uses his tremendous fame and wealth to spread awareness and even donating millions of dollars to environmental work, it shows that he is genuinely trying to help make the world a better place. He is by no means a scientist, but he uses his platform to get the message out. It is clear that DiCaprio is aware of how his celebrity status will discredit what he has to say, and his critics will call him a “shallow, chuckle headed movie star.” He doesn't ignore the fact that some people don't feel his connection to environmental activism is genuine, but he still pushes his messages anyways.  DiCaprio touches on the topic of our fossil fuel addiction.
  <br><br>
The solutions include enforcing the 2015 Paris agreement, developing wind and solar power, and implementing a carbon tax. The film includes the  current impacts of climate change, from big  cities like  Miami, to small island  nations. I was grateful that the film did not shy from showing the large, spanning oil fields, the carbon bomb that forms when cutting down forests, and the destruction of the Indonesian land to make room for palm oil production, which is in nearly everything we buy. I also liked how DiCaprio himself admits that his carbon footprint is bigger than most because it is apparent that his in touch with his own ideology. His reputation allows this documentary to be more impactful than a  traditional film release. Overall, I really enjoyed this documentary and after watching it, there is no denying DiCaprio’s passion and commitment to spreading awareness of climate change.

I found the film “Before the Flood” very eye-opening. I also thought it was a great choice to have Leonardo DiCaprio be the main protagonist. He's a well-known celebrity and people are more inclined to pay attention and act quickly if they are being instructed to do so by a person they admire. It was very eye-opening to see that Dicaprio was so invested in fixing the downward spiral that is the climate crisis. If more celebrities donated and took action like he was then we wouldn't be having this problem. Celebrities are very influential people, everyone looks up t at least one celebrity, and if they all put messages out like similar to this, many people would be persuaded in changing things in their everyday lives to help the cause.  
   <br><br>

One major point in the documentary that frustrated me the most was how much politics got involved. People are literally being paid off to produce facts that climate change isn't real in the hopes of creating more profit for huge businesses. Businesses such as ExxonMobil who wouldn't have a business would it not be for the fossil fuels they are producing. Florida is going to be the most affected short term. But the republican representatives are in such denial or are getting paid off to say that this is a myth and there is no such thing as climate change. This is going to persuade the people of florida with false information contributing to the climate crisis even further.

I think Before the Flood did a great job at explaining man-made global warming within an hour and a half documentary. The film included environmental, economic, political and social factors contributing to the climate change issue, educating the viewer on a wide range of factors making up this issue. The political dimension was the most interesting to me because it successfully communicated how much faster we could prevent the climate from changing if American politicians would stop preventing and blocking environmental laws from enactment. The political situation is too corrupt from oil and gas company funding, and once again, people in power are the ones stopping us from making change. The film also did a great job communicating the influence America has in the world wide climate change discourse. As Sunita Narain, who works with the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), New Delhi and who was interviewed in the film put it, if America, one of the most powerful countries in the world and also the second country emitting the most greenhouse gases passed a carbon tax or some sort of change or law that held our actions accountable, other countries will learn from America’s leadership.
   <br><br>

Another positive aspect of the film is the diversity of locations presented. It truly evidenced how the climate is changing all over the world whether we hear about it in the news or not. I think one of the goals of the film is to move the audience through its visual scenes with no voice overs, making the viewer take in and appreciate the beautiful expanses of nature contrasted with scenes of fire and destruction. 
   <br><br>

Lastly, one way to look at Leonardo DiCaprio being the spokesperson could be through an advertising perspective. To put it simply, there could be an aspect of celebrity endorsement in the issue, but I do not think it is necessarily a negative thing. More people may be inclined to watch the film because of DiCaprio’s presence, along with interview cameos with others like Barack Obama and Elon Musk.

<p>
In the film, Before the Flood, Leonardo DiCaprio visits several countries on earth that are affected by climate change. This film details the severity of climate change and how there are people on this planet already greatly suffering from the effects of anthropogenic climate change. For example, the film shows the struggles of the people living near coastlines while the sea level is constantly rising. DiCaprio also interviews several influential people such as the Pope and Elon Musk and displays their dedication and wishes for a greener and thriving earth. 

   <br><br>

Through this film, I learned about the effects of rising sea levels on coastline communities. I was shocked that people would turn a blind eye to the effects of climate change even though there is an urgent need to quickly enact change. I feel pessimistic about the future of this planet because there are just so many issues related to climate change (e.g. rising oceans, deforestation of crucial forests, pollution in urban areas) that it seems impossible to curb all their effects within the next 50 years. In addition, our lawmakers seem to be ignoring the climate crisis. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the film because of all the perspectives on the effects of climate change it provided and how it pushes for awareness on those negative effects.

The film “Before the Flood” made me lope hope for our future. It explains the climate crisis very well and what people are doing to change it. This film showed me the impact climate change is having on the lives of people who have done little to nothing to make the climate what it is today. Seeing the farmers in India and the people on the islands be impacted by something they have no control over was very saddening. These people have probably some of the smallest carbon footprints in the world but they will be paying much of the price. This made me realize that while climate change is an environmental issue, it is also an issue of human rights. Do people in remote parts of the world really deserve to suffer so Americans can eat another hamburger? I know the issue of climate change is not that simple, however change needs to start somewhere and our generation needs to be the one to push it forth. 
   <br><br>

Although the film does a good job of showing the climate crisis one would still need to have a little knowledge of how greenhouse gases impact the planet to be able to fully comprehend this film. Something that I thought was very interesting was the factory that was being built by Tesla. It was nice seeing a big company like Tesla doing so much to change the environment. It was inspiring to see that there are some countries like Germany, Sweden, Denmark who are doing so much to incorporate renewable energy into their everyday lives. Seeing these countries take such drastic steps and implement such changes makes one wonder why can’t we do that? While it is nice to see these positive things happening I also know that this won't do much because some of the biggest culprits of the climate crisis are quiet. Additionally, after knowing that the US has pulled out of the Paris Agreement it is obvious that not much will change in the world if the 2nd largest emitter of greenhouse gases isn't doing much to stop it. I would definitely recommend this movie to a friend because I feel that it is very informative.

An inconvenient sequel:
   <br><br>
Following Al Gore’s footsteps in An Inconvenient Sequel was an enlightening journey as it revealed a lot about the interworking of the United States’ political landscape. Contrary to other documentaries that focuses primarily on the environmental facts and details, An Inconvenient Sequel helps the audience understand why the fight against climate change is not  even close to the magnitude that it needs to be at. 
   <br><br>
There were a couple of events in the film that displayed the blatant failure and corruption of the American democracy. One was the flooding in Florida. The streets were completely flooded in Florida and like the reading said, there is no hope of Miami surviving climate change. The city will be lost. However, the mayor of Florida still did not acknowledge climate change. Gore rhetorically questions how the mayor can wade through the flooded streets and still claim that climate change does not exist. Even when the evidence is obviously there, the democratically appointed mayor would rather submit to the pressure from corporations than work to protect his own city and people from being destroyed.
   <br><br>
Another incident was the conversation between the Indian man and Al Gore. Climate change is destroying India, with smog so thick that it obstructs the sun and weather so hot that it melts the streets. The man is disappointed because the US did not take the lead in climate change. He questions why the US was allowed to destroy the earth’s climate in order to reap quick and immediate benefits, while India cannot do the same and must instead suffer the consequences. Similar to the man, I am very disappointed in the failures of our government. The United States always tries to act as the world’s protector and leader. However it fails to protect even its own people from a phenomenon so catastrophic that it can destroy the entire planet. I hope the government will wake up soon so we can take action in reversing all the damage that has been done by our country.

"An Inconvenient Sequel"
   <br><br>
This film mainly talks about Al Gore, the former president, as an environmentalist, advocates, and promotes the public’s actions to fight for the climate crisis. He launches a training program that allows people to learn how to communicate environmental issues with others. Additionally, thousands of Al Gore’s climate trainees are leaders in the movement. I found this film inspiring because he acts as a role model for many environmentalists. He devotes his life to find solutions to the climate crisis. The fact that he was one of the former presidents also adds the credibility and reputation of his words and actions. 
   <br><br>


The film also shows us the Typhoon Haiyan, rain bombs, and droughts in different locations around the world, and such severenesses has caused millions of death. Furthermore, the burning of coal, oil, and gas that emits carbon emission is the main reason for the rising temperatures of the earth. This CO2 emission is said to drop down to zero-emission in the Paris Agreement. Moreover, Trump withdrew the U.S. from global climate agreement and promoted the coal industry and fracking, which move backward to a consuming stage. 

   <br><br>

Even though political power sometimes delays the progress, Al Gore never gives up his goal. For example, the discover satellite was a design to get the scientific data of earth, which helps to track the environmental change. Nevertheless, the government canceled the launch until President Obama allocated the money, which finally allows the launching of the satellite. Even though numerous challenges restrict our process toward zero-emission, many countries have been working hard to be green and efficient. For instance, Chile has an additional 13.3 GW of solar projects approved or under construction, and African rooftop has solar panels. Additionally, India gets over 1 billion from world bank for installing solar panels. There is no reason for us to sit still and not advocate for regulations and investment in renewable energy.

DiCaprio’s film “Before the Flood” is an extremely admirable contribution to spreading awareness of climate change. After watching the film, I feel more aware of the problem and its’ impacts as well as more hopeful that there is truly something we can do. DiCaprio made wonderful use of his status as an influential public figure to bring about positive change by educating viewers about the impacts of climate change and how many people will be impacted by it, whether we want to believe it or not. He emphasizes the fact that climate change needs immediate attention and that we need to act fast - climate change is not a problem that can be ignored any longer. He also made an important point in emphasizing the fact that the climate crisis will likely have the most drastic impact on poorer regions, who have contributed the least to emissions. DiCaprio reminds his audience that, it is our responsibility, as people who have more influence on the course of climate change, to take positive action in order to protect the planet and its inhabitants, no matter who they are. However, what stands out to me most about the film is how comprehensive it is. In just an hour and a half, DiCaprio is able to explain the causes of climate change, its global impacts, and offer up potential solutions without sacrificing empathy or the significance of the issue.

<p>
After watching An Inconvenient Sequel and Before the Flood I can see similar tactics in raising awareness. Both Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio travel the world and witness the climate disasters with their own eyes and share that with the audience. They also both provide a political viewpoint into the crisis. For example they both visit glaciers and show how the ice is literally melting before our eyes as well as the poor air quality of China. I think they both are attacking the problem in a similar way in that they are educating people on how climate change is ALREADY taking effect, maybe not as strong in the US or Europe, but in the poorer nations who contribute the least.
   <br><br>

I really found it interesting having a glimpse into the political side of the issue. It is important that the people we elect to make decisions on our behalf are aware of the problems and are formulating plans of actions. From the coverage of the COP in Paris in "An Inconvenient Sequel", we can see that India argued to get the benefits of fossil fuels that the US and other developed nations got. After discussion, an agreement was made that involved every nation agreeing on trying to limit warming to only 2 degrees. However, this agreement is just a promise, not an enforcement. This means that we must trust that each nation is trying their best to limit carbon emissions. What was the most disappointing is that in the very end of the film it was revealed that Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement. This truly made me distraught and angry because by Trump's decision we are now taking a step back in the wrong direction. I am ashamed to be a part of a selfish nation who is contributing to the problem and not trying to solve it. Thankfully, I know that Americans are still trying to live sustainably despite our president's decision to pull out of the agreement.

After watching the film "Before the Flood" I learned a lot more about climate change and how much damage the human population has done to this planet. I was angery with the fact of how much impact the U.S has had in climate change. The U.S knows there is climate change yet many politicians refuse to believe there is so they can continue to burn fossil fuel and get more rich by it. The part that bothers me the most is that the poor countries like India and Africa suffer the most from the action of the wealthy countries like the U.S and China. It broke my heart seeing how that poorer farmer's crops were flooded by the rain, that way his way of survival and it has all been wiped out due to climate change. In the U.S Miami is suffering from floods that occur on hot sunny summer days. The country that burns the most fossil fuel is U.S and they are not doing anything to stop the burning of fossil fuels. 
   <br><br>
The picture that Leonardo DiCaprio brings up is very intersection because it has three stages. The first is the creation of the world, then another one that begins to look different, and finally one that is dark and scary. The last one the one that symbolizes what the world will look like in a few more years due to climate change. The air will be so polluted we will no longer be able to breathe it. It looks so dark and ugly like a horror movie but that's how the future will look like if we don't change the way we eat and what we produce. What really got to me was how by 2050 we will be able to sail through the North Pole because the ice will melt, and where will that water go? It will cause the sea level to rise and go up and will flood cities near the coasts. 
   <br><br>
This film was released four years ago and yet nothing by countries that were present in Paris have taken action into this problem humans have created. The ones that have suffered the most are animals. In Australia kangaroos and koalas have been burned alive due to the wildfire the drought has caused. This film shows different parts throughout the world and how climate change is happening fast. The wildlife's home are becoming uninhabitable for the wild life. Species are becoming extinct each day, yet the human population does not feel alarm by global warming. What is the point of saying you care about life yet no one is doing anything to protect life. If the U.S government would do more for the earth other countries will do so swell. Actions speak louder than words yet nothing has been done.

In the movie, “Before the Flood,” Leonardo DiCaprio leads the audience to learn about climate change and global warming, and how the environmental crisis is going on. Instead of presenting research data and analysis results, this documentary does not introduce the this topic like most scientific documentaries did but presents the climate issue from scientific, economical, and political aspects. The climate change has already happened in the world, and it will extend its impacts to human daily life. This documentary also showed audience that though climate change is serious and will exaggerate if people still ignore it, humans can solve the problem in the future as long as humans would pay attention to this issue. This documentary does not try to alarm people by presenting terrible and horrifying environmental conditions, but it enhance the public understanding about the environmental problems and  give people hopes to encourage people to take actions for climate changes. 
    <br><br>
The documentary also shows some opposite ideas about climate change. Some politicians and businessmen doubet about the existence of the climate crisis. I think we should worry about not only how serious climate change is but also human attitude towards climate changes. When the government tries to spend more money to convince the public that climate crisis does not exist, it is better for the government to spend money on promoting the constructions of environmental-friendly facilities.

<p>
Honestly I’m surprised to see Mr. DiCaprio, who has long been famous for being rich and playboy both on screen and in real life, advocating for global warming. But my bias against him was changed after watching the movie. Not only did he took serious steps in gathering information like interviewing scientist of various fields and politicians from different countries, taking field trips to places from Southern Florida to the North Pole, and making speeches and stand out publicly for the course he believes in despite pressure imposed by political and commercial forces, but he also take concrete steps like changing his diet and making provoking documentaries like “before the flood”.
    <br><br>

In my opinion, Leo’s role as a learner instead of a preacher not only makes the unfold of the plot in this film smooth and easily understandable for its audience, but it also makes the heavy topic of global warming itself more likable. People are mostly sick of seeing politicians shouting at each other, arguing over if global warming is a true matter, or scientists holding researches with several hundred pages and making debates using statistics and professional terms that we hardly pay attention to.
    <br><br>

Throughout the movie, he brought up the emotional appeal of the audience by showing them the beauty of the seals in North Pole, the melting glaciers of Greenland, the food and energy deficiency the poor in India are facing, the flooding Kiribati… These scenes, the beautiful or the cruel side of this world that they reveal, makes its audience wonder: do we really want our next generation, or perhaps ourselves, to live in a world without all these stunning landscapes and amazing creatures, or live just to endure the polluted sky and ice less world. If not thinking about the question from this angle, he brought up other concerns through the politicians and authorities of other fields that, we must consider the damage it might cause to mankind. The migration of human and the fighting over precious resources such as water well take place sooner or later due the fact that this planet is becoming uninhabitable, by the time, war, diseases, the inflow of refugees would cause more trouble than action we can take right now to slower the process of global warming.

I had never heard of the film Before the Flood or that Leonardo DiCaprio was a climate activist until this course. Through this film we are able to see first hand examples of climate  change in regions of the world that we otherwise would not be exposed to. Using Leonardo DiCaprio as the spokesperson for this  movie I think was a genius idea because people love to listen to celebrities and he has a bug influence on people. I was shocked when I saw that DiCaprio was speaking infront of officials about the issue of climate change.
    <br><br>
May favorite part of the movie is when they are looking at the map of the world on the big screen. We were able to see the drastic differences in the climate, wind patterns, stream  patterns, etc. and it  really showed how "global warming" is so  much more than we thought it would be, and how it truly is a climate crisis.

<p>
This film was extremely eye opening to me in a vast amount of ways. This documentary truly captured many of the extreme hardships our planet is currently facing and is inevitably going to face if our climate crisis is not mitigated. The most astounding parts of the film, in my opinion, were those centered around the political aspect of our climate crisis. It is very evident that many important changes are not being made around the world due to corrupt governments, political figures who do not believe in the issue of climate change, and multimillion-dollar companies who are simply paying off lawmakers. As long as people are still relying on fossil fuels for everyday activities, oil companies are going to continue to make millions and be able to pay off law making officials. Sadly, our government and many around the world, are motivated entirely by profit, so lawmakers are not always going to work in favor of the people if they can benefit from large investors. This is not an easy issue to fix as it extends far beyond the issue of simply implementing laws regarding climate change. 
     <br><br>

Regarding the issue of climate change denial, I was astonished by the number of highly educated people who truly did not believe humans have inflicted negative change on our planet. At this point in time, I believe there is countless evidence to suggest that climate change is indeed taking place today and will continue to worsen as years go by. It is very possible that many of these deniers are being paid off by companies invested in the oil industry, but there are many average American citizens not involved in the industry who simply do not believe in it either. Before we can rely on citizens and lawmakers to make drastic changes in their lives for the sake of our planet, I believe we need to focus on educating people on the issue.

In the film “Before the Flood” the current events of climate change are viewed and it explains how much worse these situations are going to be. One of the most concerning events to me is how fast the ice is melting. In the film a long instrument is shown to demonstrate just how much of the ice has melted away. Additionally DiCaprio shows how his cast is chasing snow for a movie he is participating in. On of his crew members mentions how it is concerning that kids in the future will not be able to see what snow looks like because of how fast all the ice and snow is melting away everywhere. Knowing that maybe someday there will snow will be nothing but a myth is astonishing and concerning to me. The film also touches on how many scientist sell their credentials in order to claim that climate change is not happening. Their actions may give them temporary wealth but they will have no future if their actions continue to cause people to not take action. Giving people false information that is inaccurately backed up causes people to not believe and therefore not take any action to help the crisis. Not only does DiCaprio capture the problems but the film presents some possible solutions that could help the crisis. One solution demonstrated in the film was solar powered battery packs. The idea is that the sun will power very strong battery packs that can store lots of energy and supply that energy to a village even on a cloudy day. I thought that this was an extraordinary idea that seems to be doable and more companies should take action into creating these gigafactories that can help flip the switch to the crisis. In total, the film was eye opening because i was really able to see the effects of climate change that i often hear about and are hard to picture.

The film "Before the Flood" did a good job at exposing the life-threatening effects of global warming. I believe that films like these are more important than facts and figures. An appeal to emotions is, in my opinion, the best way to spread awareness about climate change and persuade people to act environmentally conscious. Someone telling you about the fires in Australia is not the same as someone showing you a picture of rescued koalas from the fires. I want to point out that having an A list celebrity like Leonardo Dicaprio actually does more for climate change than having an accredited scientist talk about what deforestation and CO2 pollution does to our atmosphere. I mean, Leonardo Dicaprio is an icon, a public figure with arguably a lot more influence than many scientist (excluding Bill Nye). I thought it was ridiculous how news anchors were criticizing Leo for voicing his opinion on global warming. Can they not see that Leo is for the culture? I mean, here is a person that, for my generation, we grew up watching him act in many of the big blockbuster movies of our time. He deservedly has the title of being "cool". By Leo associating himself with an issue as serious as climate change, being environmentally conscious becomes cool.

I really enjoyed the film. It was well narrated, well edited, and it also invited a number of credible and influential people into the conversation. But although these films show the devastating effects of CO2 pollution and everything that causes global warming, I still think that there is a large disconnect between what is shown to be the effects of climate change and how it is caused in the first place. 
     <br><br>
Lastly, I wanted to mention that Leonardo said something really sad but profound at the opening of the film when he talked over his U.N. speech. He said that if the U.N. knew how he really felt about climate change and how pessimistic he real is about the future of this planet, then they might have chosen the wrong guy to be the United Nations' Messenger of Peace. There are people who are well educated on climate change and don't see a hope for the future, and that scares me. It scares me to think that we may lose this fight without ever having fought back.

The documentary  "Before The Flood" really touched my heart
more than the other ones. This film made me want to take action and did a very good job of bringing the
viewers on a journey with Leonardo Dicaprio to see the effects of climate change. There is no doubt that
climate change is real, it's up to us as the human race to try our best to help the earth. This film was more
on the emotional side for me, rather than intellectual because its sad to know that everyone including
myself have contributed to major emissions. Leonardo Dicaprio does a very well job of asking people
questions and goes through every single detail that someone must know to understand climate change.
The film goes back to this painting that Leonard had as a baby and shows us that if we do not take action
now, that our world is so much more danger than what it is now. Unfortunately, people that are running
our country right now are ignorant and have pulled us out of the Paris agreement, as individual states we
need to come together to make an effort to produce less greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. This film
was overall excellent and I would highly recommend it to a friend.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film, “Before the Flood”. Before watching, I expected the film to be a representation of an alarmist perspective on climate change; one that is usually described as overdramatic. Instead, I was surprised to find that the movie did a wonderful job of portraying the facts of the climate crisis as well as the effects it will have on the entire world in the coming future. I especially enjoyed the way that it illustrated the impression climate change is making on other countries besides the United States, highlighting the fact that we are not alone in this fight. I was most intrigued when Leonardo DiCaprio was interviewing Narain, a female leader from India. She puts the United States’ fossil fuel consumption under a magnifying glass. As she shows DiCaprio charts of the amount of electricity consumed at home by a single American compared to a citizen of other countries such as Germany, China, and India, you can see the look of concern on Leonardo's face. She also explains to DiCaprio that the world needs to put lifestyle and consumption at the center of climate negotiations and she believes that this begins in America. We are the leading nation, one that other countries look up to in government, policies, and advancement. She argues that India and China are investing much more in solar energy that America and that we have shown no sign of increasing our investment any time soon. This opened my eyes to the fact that we are a fossil-addicted nation and if we can reduce our fossil fuel consumption we can start a chain reaction among the rest of the world, possibly saving us from any more harm in the coming years. She argues that this alone should make it clear that the climate crisis is real and urgent, “not a figment of their imagination.” The U.S. has been the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in history and our carbon footprint is going everyday. 
     <br><br>
This film does a great job of returning to this point, concentrating on the causes of the climate crisis rather than scaring its viewers with the future scenarios. Although, it does include a look into what our world will look like if the climate crisis continues or even increase. The section of the movie that depicts the climate simulation was very intriguing. To see the rise in surface temperature, the poles melting, the predicted drought in The Dust Bowl, and the slowing of the Gulf Stream currents through these images was beyond interesting. It made the issue feel more real and factual; something that we need to find a way out of.

The documentary “Before The Flood” changed the way I viewed the United States’ contribution to the climate crisis. When Leonardo DiCaprio interviewed Sunita Narain, I thought she made some very good points about the US not doing what they preached. We tell developing countries to use solar and wind energy and yet we are not, and continue to consume the most out of all the countries. “Electricity consumed by 1 American at home is equal to 34 Indians and 61 Nigerians.” We have to make a lifestyle shift where we consume less, and that is going to be difficult to get people on board.

These are some quotes that stood out to me in this movie:  
     <br><br>
“If this boat is sinking, then we will all have to sink together.” Secretary General Ban Ki Moon
     <br><br>
“We keep finding things that aren’t in the climate models that are used to predict the future.” Prof Jason Box

The documentary I watched was Before the Flood. I thought this was an excellent documentary that covered a whole range of issues from the various causes of climate change all the way to the political end of the spectrum trying to dive into the vested interests behind climate skepticism and denial and confusing the public. 
      <br><br>
I thought there mocking of Leonardo DiCaprio for being an actor who would advocate for a ‘fake’ crisis considering acting is all about playing ‘fake’ characters was uncalled for. I was absolutely shocked to find out that a scientist who published a graph on the ‘hockey stick’ (unprecedented warming) of rising temperatures received death threats! This pointed some light as to why the issue has not been a high priority: the climate deniers who almost always have money from fossil fuel companies will defend the view that allows the to keep their. At this point, anthropogenic contribution to climate change is so blatantly obvious that now the denial campaigns focus on confusing the public, as the documentary said they don’t need to win the scientific debate, just divide the public. It was insane to me that fossil fuel interests buy our senate, our Congress, and or Environmental Committee (are you kidding me that the head of the Environmental committee is a climate change skeptic who gets money from fossil fuel industries?). Of course we can’t get ambitious climate policy passed, 131 climate deniers still reside in Congress! 
      <br><br>
One thing that shocked me was how the production of palm oil requires vast clearing of forests to make room on the land to grow it. When the lady from Indonesia was speaking, she shocked me when she said the deforestation and burning of forests acts like a carbon bomb releases massive amounts of stored Carbon in the atmosphere. I was mind blown when she threw out this fact: Forest fires in Indonesia releases more carbon daily into the atmosphere than the entire US economy. This also makes me think that the IPCC is underestimating how much warming will come in the next 50 years. 
     <br><br>
 I really like the mentioning of the consumption of meat and its greenhouse gas effect. I related to it alot because last quarter I wrote a 12 page paper on the environmental ethics and impacts of consumption of meat, and the greenhouse gas emissions of consuming factory farmed meat are preposterous. I don’t think most people know that livestock is the second largest contributor to climate change worldwide. And that beef requires 50x more land than rice, wheat, and potato as the documentary mentioned. And how do we have all this land: WE DEFOREST. Which means less absorption of CO2 (b/c plants are natural carbon sinks) and all the carbon stored in those plants gets released into the atmosphere, furthering climate change significantly. And all the methane that is released as a result of consuming factory farmed meat (especially beef) is insane. I am currently a vegetarian myself, and writing my paper on the ethics of eating meat really solidified my decision. The climate impact it has does not line up with our ethical obligations to leaving a secure and plentiful earth for future generations. 
     <br><br>
 Lastly,I liked the point about how climate change is going to take away from our food production and how this tension has a great potential to start wars. This reminded me of the David Wallace Wells article and his section on “Perpetual War”. Scarce resources is going to cause huge tension and protest, as this is already happening in places around the world. Overall, I very much enjoyed watching Before the Flood, and I think a great vocation. for anyone (like the guy at the end with stage 4 cancer) is to contribute to the fight against climate change any way then can!

“Before the Flood” is an amazing film that well describes the multi-faceted issues surrounding the climate crisis. One of the main issues that most bothered me was the fact that the United States is not taking a leading roll in fighting against climate change. As a global superpower we should be much more committed to making lasting changes to reduce our emissions. Especially in the wake of the Trump presidency, however, this has not been a reality. “Before the Flood” displays the frustration of other countries, namely India, at America’s lack of action. I found this incredibly disheartening. If the leaders of our country were more committed to solving the climate crisis, I believe individuals would similarly be more inclined to change their own behavior. The second issue highlighted in “Before the Flood” that I found especially shocking was the negative attitudes of popular media against activists like Leonardo DiCaprio. Many news outlets were claiming that he shouldn’t be trusted because he’s “just an actor.” I also found this disheartening. Even though people like Leonardo DiCaprio aren’t climate scientists, they are still incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about the issue. Everyone needs to have that same level of passion about the climate crisis in order for actual change to be made. It is detrimental to downplay what someone is saying about climate change simply because of their career or lack of certain qualifications. Instead, their background in climate activism should be taken into consideration.

<p>
I really like how “Before the Flood” fully shows how the climate crisis is a global issue by showing the effects of climate change around the world, and not just the U.S. This is extremely unfair when you consider how our country is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse emissions, yet other countries suffer the consequences the most. Additionally, it’s shameful how little action we have taken, especially because we have contributed so much and we consider ourselves a “world leader.” The politicians who can make so much difference have instead dismissed the issue with statements like “man can’t change the climate”- all while countries like India go without electricity or countries like China deal with large scale health concerns because of smog. On a side note, I really like how Leonardo DiCaprio uses his platform as a famous celebrity to address the climate crisis. His publicity status and genuine passion for the environment makes him a great spokesperson for the documentary.

“An Inconvenient Sequel” was very well done in my opinion. I think it was more powerful than “Before the Flood” because Al Gore is a reliable, reputable and powerful narrator. Leonardo Decaprio did a good job in “Before the Flood” but the effect was different because he was learning throughout the movie about Climate Change, whereas in “An Inconvenient Sequel” Al Gore is a knowledgeable narrator and directs the movie in a way that takes the viewer through his struggle and efforts to create change, while also explaining the issues at hand. By doing this, Al Gore is showing what people can do to help, how important these issues are while inspiring his audience as well.
     <br><br>

I really liked “An Inconvenient Sequel” because it discussed all of the very prevalent issues in the Climate Change crisis and how large and complicated the issue is. For example, it showed politicians within the last 20 years and how they refuse to believe in Climate Change or create policies to stop burning fossil fuels, no matter how much scientific evidence is given. The film shows Al Gore’s efforts to educate people and inspire people. Al Gore gave special talks to teach people how to do what he’s doing, which is to travel the world and educate people about the problems our world is facing and how dire the issues are. The film shows people dying due to climate change and how our lives are changing. It is sad and scary to hear the effects of climate change not only on the environment but on the human race as well. I think Al Gore continues to impress his viewers with his passion for our earth and not letting climate change deniers and serious setbacks stop him from doing the right thing and demanding change.

My mom is a writing professor at UCSD. She teaches a class on the climate and food ethics and published a textbook on the topic, but I still learned a vast amount of information watching this film. Specific case studies were especially of interest and importance. One example of this is the situation in Kiribati--to the point where Kiribati has bought a portion of Fiji for their residents to move to. Another example is the ideas presented to DiCaprio in India: how can India be expected to not create a problem in the future that the U.S. created in the past? This film is very extensive in its study of the causes and effects of climate change. From the projected eventual absolute destruction of coral reefs to extreme pollution in the Indonesian rainforest, climate change is affecting--and will continue to affect at higher and higher levels--basically all sectors of our lives. As the film draws toward a close, an emphasis is placed on the fact that the problems posed by climate change are fixable. This idea is strongly advocated for by climate experts, then-President Obama, and Holy Father Francis. We are currently approaching a breaking point in the situation, though, and now has to be the time to begin aggressively combating the sources of climate change. I believe that this film does an impressive job of educating its viewers on the massive downfalls of climate change while still eventually enforcing that we can still reverse the current trends with hard and focused work.

I thought that the way Before the Flood was put together was excellent. It was very smart to have Dicaprio as the protagonist. He is known worldwide and is very well-liked. Some people might have watched just because he was in the film. I had no idea that Dicaprio was an environmental activist which I found to be very interesting. Some celebrities just post about climate change but don’t actually do anything to help make a change, even though they have millions of dollars. I admire Dicaprio for using his fame to spread awareness and make a change. 
     <br><br>
At the beginning of the film, Ban Ki-moon said that we all sink together which really got me thinking. There are a lot of poor countries that are barely contributing to the rise in CO2 emissions. Those countries will have to face the effects of climate change even though the industrialized countries are mainly causing it. The people fighting climate crisis and doing whatever they can to lower their carbon footprint will also suffer the consequences of climate change because big companies aren’t doing much to lower their emissions. It isn’t fair that some people are doing what they can to avoid climate change, while others continue about their day and just avoiding, believing in, or thinking about climate change. 
     <br><br>
I also found it unbelievable that some climate scientists have received death threats for simply warning the public about climate change. I don’t know if people do that because they are scared of the future or because they simply do not believe in it at all.

The politics of climate change denial, as briefly described in "Before the Flood," is what really made a lasting impact on me and showed the magnitude of small minded incompetence currently running the world's greatest CO2 emitters. It is so sadistically ironic that the technology we have developed in order to improve our quality of life will ultimately destroy all chances of quality life. The Bosch painting showcased at the beginning and end of the film was a brilliant way of incorporating the prophetic aspect of man vs. nature throughout history. In this constant battle between human existence and nature's survival there is no 'winning side.' It's like a pendulum going between Earth and man, swinging violently when either side acts in extremities and hanging still when both are in perfect harmony.  In simple science terms the phrase, "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction" explains our current phenomenon perfectly. We have been destroying the Earth for decades and are now reaping the consequences of our catastrophically selfish actions. I agree with Leo in his pessimistic sentiment about the Paris agreement being a good step, but not  enough. Without any means of enforcing the agreements made by these nations, it is likely only a fraction of what was promised will be delivered. At this point it's up to the consumers, the everyday citizens, to help change the impending fate of our planet. We can no longer be the 'everyday consumer,' but instead be active conservers. We have to learn to relinquish our unnecessary amenities and mindless consumption and give back to the Earth that has provided so much for us. It was also shocking to learn that the average American consumes 34x the amount of electricity as a person in India. A major change must be made to our culture which encourages such greed and gluttony.

The film, "Before the Flood," works well to present the truth of climate change in an undeniable way. I think that I would definitely rather have the undeniable truth of climate change. Having the truth rather than not knowing the extent of damage that we are doing to our planet is far more helpful in that it empowers me with the knowledge that action must be taken on both a personal and collective level.  
     <br><br>


Watching this film gave me a severe sense of urgency that I had not felt when reading Wallace Well's "The Uninhabitable Earth." Where Wallace Well's article filled me with a deep sense of dread upon first reading the piece, this documentary made me hopeful for a collective social and political change. The documentary also inspired me to make personal changes in my life in order to minimize my carbon footprint and help protect our planet. I believe this vast difference in my response to these to pieces that are both trying to urge the audience to action is because of the additional content that movies are able to communicate. The videos of various animals and plants evokes a want in me to protect this planet that is our home. 


     <br><br>

Furthermore the movie also shows actual action being taken by world leaders and countries to minimize the effects of climate change. While these actions may not be as much as is necessary to completely mitigate the terror of climate change, they are a first step. It showed me that I should not be apathetic about this issue when there are others fighting for all of humanity and the entire planet. It also showed the suffering of many humans as a result of climate change which directly appealed to my pathos.

The film "An Inconvenient Sequel" follows former Vice President Al Gore on his journey to spread climate change awareness. It was very inspiring to see how much work Al Gore puts in to educating people about climate change, despite continuous backlash and hate. People constantly attempt to destroy his credibility and deny the fact that climate change is a huge issue, but it is so important for people like Al Gore to continue with this fight. This film helped to validate our frustrations with people in power by showing how many public figures, including our president, actively ignore the climate crisis and contribute to worsening the effects of climate change. Something brought up in the film that I found particularly interesting was the United States' contribution to the climate crisis compared to our contribution to fighting climate change. In a conversation between Al Gore and an Indian leader about the transition to using reusable energy, the man from India argued that since America has been one of the leading contributors to the climate crisis, that we should not expect everyone else to be doing more to fight the crisis than we are. I feel like this is very important to acknowledge because the United States has made a gigantic impact in worsening the climate compared to practically all other countries. Therefore, we should be focusing more of our time, energy, and money in changing our own country, rather than telling other countries what they can do to help. While I agree, that we all need to be aware of just how dangerous the climate crisis is and that we should all be doing what we can to fight climate change, I believe that America has an awful habit of inserting itself into the problems of other countries, rather than acknowledging and trying to solve our own issues. This hypocrisy needs to stop in order for the U.S. to make a difference in the climate crisis. Overall, I found this film very interesting and educational, however it was also very difficult to watch at times due to how heartbreaking some of the scenes were.

I completely agree that Al Gore is extremely inspiring in terms of trying to initiate change. I think this was evident throughout the entire film, especially seeing him initially fail to launch his satellite but ultimately be able to follow through on the project. I also find it the conversation that Al Gore had with the Indian representative about adapting a renewable energy approach rather than the implementation of coal plants. I found his arguments to be particularly interesting, when he references all the benefits that the US were able to gain through the use of coal in terms of creating jobs, advancing infrastructure, improving technology. To me, there is such a blatant form of hypocrisy that is highlighted through the actions of the US government. As you mentioned, they have a tendency to insert themselves in solving other people problems, which I think creates this illusion that they are above everyone else. I think this is also highlighted in the discussion for India to consider renewable energy. How can the US expect other countries to be on board, and not have the same opportunities to expand in the same way that the States was able to for over 150 years! The US really does need to start focusing on reverting the issues that they have so heavily contributed to. It is also extremely frustrating to see them pull out of the Paris agreement. I myself am not a US citizen, and have talked to many of my American friends about this issue, and it's very upsetting so see the amount of frustration and disapproval they have towards their own government, which is why I think political figures, or ex-political figures, like Al Gore are extremely necessary and inspirational for the American youth.

"Before the Flood" presents an interesting way to investigate climate change. Leonardo DiCaprio is meant to be an "everyman", the relatable protagonist that we can see ourselves in. However, DiCaprio is not an everyman: he is a celebrity, instantly recognizable with a quick glance. The difference between DiCaprio as a celebrity activist and other celebrities who give token platitudes about the environment is that he is a celebrity AND an activist. As his naysayers note, he has no scientific training, but neither do most of the people watching this documentary. Additionally, having such a familiar face is a useful ploy to garner interest in the topics of the film. Overall, "Before the Flood" provides another valid method of presenting climate change to a broad audience.
     <br><br>


As for the actual topics covered in "Before the Flood," his meetings with Professor Jason Box at the Greenland ice sheet and Dr. Sunita Narain from the Centre for Science and Environment in Delhi, India provide pivotal scenes that support the film. The images of the ice melt flowing to the ocean provides a visual for a central issue in climate change. With this scene, viewers who feel removed from the poles are provided insight into what the morphing landscape looks like as the ice melts. It's an effective representation of how climate change is occurring right now. With DiCaprio's meeting with Dr. Narain, the hypocrisy of the U.S. is criticized. While we may demand global change and pretend to spearhead environmentalism (depending on the administration), we are not an environmentally friendly nation. As Dr. Narain stated: "If it was that easy, I would really have liked the U.S. to move to solar." Furthermore, DiCaprio's meeting with Dr. Narain raises the dilemma of valuing human lives and standards of living versus environmentalism. People in India would have a higher standard of living if receiving energy made from cheap coal. When discussing the climate crisis, we need to remember that individuals can't single-handedly fix the planet, and instead we must create greater movements to disseminate information, gain political power, and demand sustainable alternatives to create lasting change.

The lectures, readings, and film this week have caused me some internal panic, but I am glad I feel that way. It has also caused me to think about things that I contribute to climate change. But as a first year college student, I have been questioning how the heck should I get involved in a way where I can change things. Dicaprio even says that we are passed the individual work like changing your lightbulb. So now I am wondering how I fit in. Protesting? Voting? Community service? Consumerism culture? I am on a more plant based diet but is that enough? I can't exactly break the bank. Dicaprio asked questions that resonated with me: "What is the right thing to do?" and "Are we doing it too slowly?"

     <br><br>

In response to if Dicaprio as naive as he portrays he is, he most likely isn't. The way the film is set up helps people feel included and not alone in this naivety. Dicaprio says, "The truth is, the more I've learned about this issue and everything that contribute to this problem, the more I realize how much I don't know. How much I don't know about this issue." I believe this is a feeling that most of the public, including myself, understand. He appears to be taking the perspective of an everyday person which, at his core, he is. Maybe to inform the public about this issue, you need to embark on some sort of adventure or discovery that shows the evidence of climate change. By this, the audience feels like you are talking WITH them instead of AT them.

"Before the Flood" is astonishing.  The fact is that protecting the earth needs everyone's efforts. The film indeed presented the audience with the terrific weather pattern happening on the planet due to human activities. Boreal mountains, fracking coal, offshore digging are things just happening around us, which seems unbelievable to me. Leonardo Dicaprio shows us the actual disaster that people will face or facing currently right now. He is the eyes of his audience.

Excessive use of fossil energy will not only leads to resource depletion but also warm the earth to cause ice melting in the Arctic area. Humankind will have no future if we don't save ourselves.

"An Inconvenient Sequel" was powerful because it showed what was already happening due to climate change. Real-life examples of the oceans rising and the air pollution with smog gave a visual of the impact of the climate crisis. Al Gore’s purpose throughout the whole film was to show his own journey on speaking about climate change and convincing people that there needs to be change. In his past, he has tried and failed many times to change the laws regarding pollution. During the climate conference, he did whatever it took to finally make people understand the crisis. It was also interesting to see how much the united states has influenced other developing countries and how much of a bad example we were. Not knowing the full effects of coal and oil, we viciously pumped them into the air because they were cheap. This is the same reason India is refusing to go forth with the Paris Agreement. They saw how easy and cheap it was to build a nation off of these fossil fuels. 
     <br><br>

This film showed the fears of those who have been a part of the effects of climate change. For example, the man from the Philippines who was in tears and shaking just by talking about it. His pure fear shows us how impactful it was to his community. The thousands of  It also showed the pure denial that some politicians have towards the mess they have created. We have been pulled out of the agreement and now will put even more CO2 into the air even quicker. The government needs to focus on the future of the world instead of the future of their bank balance.

<p>
Watching "An Inconvenient Sequel" gave me new insight into not only Al Gore's struggle to normalize climate change mitigation, but the climate change crisis as a whole. Just like Gore's first film "An Inconvenient Truth", he presents clear-cut evidence of climate change and global warming with many sources (photos, statistics, etc), from various locations around the world. For instance, when he travels to a climate research station located at Jakobshavn Glacier in Greenland, a researcher shows Gore how the ice levels have fallen almost twelve meters, and how the research station (known as Swiss Camp) is only supported by complex of concrete poles instead of resting on the surface of the ice sheet. This evidence that is presented by Gore is irrefutable, as the viewer can clearly see how far the ice sheet has melted down relative to the height of Swiss Camp.
     <br><br>


Another interesting aspect about Gore's film is how he presents his knowledge of the crisis to climate change deniers. For example, when he meets with local officials in Delhi, India, the officials exercise heavy doubt in his knowledge and methods of mitigating climate change. He then goes onto urge the officials to look at the city around them, and notes how it is practically impossible to see the sun in the sky due to all the smog and air pollution.
     <br><br>


Overall, the film succeeds in presenting concrete evidence on climate change, while also showing how hypocritical and uninformed climate change deniers are. If these tactics could be used more widespread in the environmental studies world, then perhaps more people would believe in this terrifying phenomenon.

Before the Flood: 
     <br><br>
I personally do not feel extremely compelled to help combat climate change. I am, nor have I ever been, a climate alarmist, activist, or contributor to the global warming crisis that our planet currently suffers from. And although I would not say that this documentary has converted me into a full-fledged climate change activist, Leonardo Dicaprio, as well as the stories he had told and the journey he had ensued, has shown the general audience - including myself - that climate change is indeed real, with real supporters and very real facts. However, even if he does not hold it himself, Leonardo Dicaprio tells stories and interviews people that display hope; hope in the idea that climate change and be properly combatted; hope in the people that can help create this change, and hope that we can and will be moving in the right direction. 
     <br><br>


Before the Paris Agreement was signed in 2016, Leonardo Dicaprio went on a two-year quest in order to discover and see the effects that climate change was having on our planet. Whether it be through the incineration of tropical rainforests in Indonesia or melting ice caps in the Artic, Dicaprio and the rest of his crew - along with the scientists that explained all of these destinations -  showed the rest of the world what climate change has been doing to our planet. One particular conversation that I found very interesting is when Leonardo traveled to India to meet Sunita Narain, who works for the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi. India, beginning the world’s third-largest emitter of carbon emissions, says that they care about climate change. However, there is one pressing issue that they care about even more: poverty. India has repeatedly said that its resources are dedicated to developing their country and bringing people out of poverty even though they care about what is happening on the planet. Narain says that “energy access is just as much of a challenge as climate change,” which, to me, sends the message that yes, climate change is a devasting, global issue, but there are national, socio-economic problems that prevent countries from fully contributing to the climate crisis. Over 300 million Indians do not have access to energy, which is equivalent to the number of people that currently reside within the United States. Coal is cheap and easily accessible for India, which is why they use coal and biomass (cow dung for example) in order to power their households. However, Nurain questions why America and other developed nations have criticized underdeveloped nations without gaining a new sense of perspective. For every 1 American in a household, they consume as much as 64 people in India. Nurain believes that America blames other countries for not using cleaner sources of energy, such as solar, but America has not done that either. In fact, we continue to build bigger while utilizing more and more nonrenewable resources. This perspective really stood out to me. There are countries with the desire to help but lack the means to do so, India being an example of that. India does emit lots of emissions, but the United States needs to be the first country to take initiative against climate change before they are going to point fingers and spread the blame. 
     <br><br>


However, throughout the entirety of the documentary, Leonardo Dicaprio expresses his sentiments of pessimism. When talking to individuals, such as Barack Obama, Dicaprio explains that he admires the former President’s optimism, alluding to the idea that he believes that it takes great will in order to achieve and maintain such strong faith in the global population’s desire to create change. This conversation stemmed from the topic of the newly signed Paris Agreement, in which countries would create an outline in order to combat the current climate crisis we face. Although President Obama went on record to say that this document will not be enough, he believes that it will move the world in the right direction, and continue to change the way that we look at climate change from here on out. What was especially compelling was the conversation that Leonardo Dicaprio had with Dr. Piers Spellings, an astronaut and the Director of the Earth Sciences Division for NASA. Dr. Spellings described his experience up in space, explaining how his ability to see the whole world up in space from his own two eyes, rather than living on it, shifted his perspective in his capacity to combat climate change. Throughout the conversation, he deploys a simulation that predicts what the Earth and its natural systems will look like in the next decades because of climate change, including the rise of water temperature, the melting of the polar caps, and the shift in climate within Europe due to waterways. Although these are very grim depictions to comprehend, Dr. Spelling remains hopeful. Being diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, his life supply is limited. However, he holds firm the idea that people can change this. He tells Dicaprio that this is reversible; that there is a way to protect our planet from climate change. I believe that the idea of hope in order to solve the planet is extremely rare to find, but is seen in the people that hold the conviction that it can be done.

The film "Before the Flood" does a great job of displaying and explaining the climate crisis that any regular person without a science background can understand. The film establishes many heartbreaking images of nature decaying at its finest. The really aimed to capture the attention of the audience by comparing before-and-after scenery of natural settings. The after images are really shocking compared to the before because of how much has changed drastically in such a short amount of time.
     <br><br>
The film also does a great job of displaying big companies as the bad guys for discrediting climate scientists for many years in hopes of stopping them in damaging any form of profit. Leonardo DiCaprio is a great example on how you can become involved in something big without having a science background.

The mayor of Florida said something that stayed with me, “The ocean is not republican or democrat. All it knows how to do is rise”. Regardless of climate change deniers and political preferences, extreme weathers will remain our schedule if the developing countries continue their capitalist agenda. 

     <br><br>

Before the Flood is an effective way to illustrate the dire need for change. The consumption of palm oil, beef, and the demand for energy has reached its tipping point and that was properly conveyed in the documentary.
     <br><br>


Additionally, I appreciated the conversation between Leonardo Dicaprio and the Indian women who had a discussion about how it is not feasible for developing countries and poor areas to just switch to solar panel. The woman refutes strongly that we need to stop the demand for disposables, energy, and oil that destroy countries who contribute the least to the climate crisis. It is up to the developing countries and policy changes that will make a difference.

The film “Before the Flood” is absolutely a great education film for the public. Before I watched this film, I have no idea that our climate is facing such a threat right now; following DiCaprio’s footprint, I realized how serious the consequences of human activities are. I used to think that climate change is far away from my life, and those scientific data look pretty abstract, but “Before the Flood” gave me really straightforward impressions on how close climate change is from us and what can we do to slow it down. What the first half of the film showed is terrifying, and I can’t help myself to feel worrying and despairing. The melting glaciers in Greenland, flooded farmlands in India, and the smoky sky in China are the most direct results of climate change; It’s hard to imagine how much we’ve been lost. There are dark facts that I’ve never heard before, for example, the companies that cut down the forest to plant palm so that they get cheaper oil, and those coal industries that paid scientists and politicians to tell public untrue information. These contents let me rethinking the way I learn about climate change before, and I can’t imagine how many people took those coal industries’ words on faith. On the last half of film, several people mentioned ways to reduce the pressure of the climate, and indeed, there are countries and individuals who work really hard to save our climate, and I’m so glad to see there is hope somewhere, and all we need to do make a change from ourselves right now.
     <br><br>

The film told us who is suffering from these pollutants and disasters: It’s the ordinary people who live in those changed areas. In the film, when DiCaprio visits the islands that flooded by tidal waves, a local man says: “The small islands nation who contribute the least tot eh causes to the climate change, are actually going to feel the worst impacts.” His words made me think of my hometown. I lived in a small coastal city for 18 years and I know that something is changing, slowly but worrying. This summer is different from any of it in my hometown city. I couldn’t walk on the street during the day because it is so hot outside that I can feel the asphalt roads is scorching my feet; all of the sunscreen and umbrella are useless, if I walked for just a little while, my skin would feel like burning. All of these never happened before. This film left me with more than incentives to change lifestyles to help slow down global warming, it left me with the hope that we should have faith on human and if people can act from now on to protect the climate, just like Doctor Sellers said, we would find a way out.

“Before the Flood,” was an engaging film and that I found fairly easy to follow. We were able to see people who are directly impacted by climate change and even how much Arctic sea ice has melted over the years. I liked that it gave us a perspective of how other parts of the world are affected by climate change―such as India―and how the United States is partly responsible for the consequences of climate change that take effect in less fortunate parts of the world. I think that this is a crucial point that more Americans need to understand and take into consideration when making lifestyle choices.
     <br><br>
The question as to whether or not actor Leonardo DiCaprio is a fit or appropriate spokesperson for the topic of climate change is something that brings about questions of credibility. DiCaprio’s involvement and activism in climate change, I believe, demonstrates that you don’t have to be a scientist or a politician to believe in and to wish to battle climate change. I think it is important for people like DiCaprio to use their pre-existing platform to raise awareness for causes that they believe are important and for such worldwide-impacting issues like climate change. The criticism he has received does not take away from the fact that he is making good use of his fame and that his concern is for all of humankind. However, I cannot help but think about the likelihood that Leonardo and his film crew flew around the world to put this documentary together, with consideration of the fact that air travel emits a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and is pretty damaging to the environment.
     <br><br>
I also found China’s approach to their air pollution very interesting and something that I believe could be effective in the United States. I also think the idea of carbon tax would be highly effective, but would cause much political uproar. Overall, DiCaprio’s film successfully addresses the topic of climate change and raise awareness as to what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint.

After I watched the film, Before the Flood, I was impressed by the fact that climate change is happening with the unbelievable speed. And it is still so sad that there are still a lot of legit news platforms even like Fox News, saying that climate change was made up by scientists. They were criticizing people like DiCaprio who are trying to help, as the zero-scientific training celebrities. However, the people on Earth are changing their minds, which is a good turning point. China is doing a really good job of spreading the idea that climate-changing is happening. The government of China is using the online platform to limit and “control” a lot of factories. China also prioritizes wind and solar energy rather than burning coal even though China has some of the largest challenges. Something really surprised me is that the production of beef will release a lot of methane into the atmosphere. As a person who eats meat, this is a fact that I would never think of. I live in the northern part of China, and I have been wanting to see snow for two years already. I think I have experienced the ice-melting and temperature rising because of the fact that where I live used to snow in the winter. I wonder whether there is anything to do with climate changing, maybe yes. It is hard to imagine that seeing snow would be a luxurious thing to do in the future.

In Leonardo DiCaprio’s Before the Flood I was able to see the true reason why climate change is still a present and ever increasing issue in our world today. Society’s leaders are torn in two, those who blatantly deny climate change and those who do believe but are doing little to nothing to combat climate change. Those who deny climate change (typically right wing voters) are persuaded by politicians who are bought by big companies more often than not, oil companies. It is sickening to know that the climate change crisis is not new information at all. Scientists have been warning the public for nearly a century but there has been very little done at a national or global scale. In my personal experience, since elementary school I have been taught to “think globally, act locally” and that by recycling and using metal straws we would save the planet. By no means am I stating that we should stop recycling or consuming so many products, but I argue that we should also be taught to protest the multi-national corporations who are the true culprits in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and in the oceans. There needs to be large, drastic and widespread change implemented not just in the local scale but in the national scale with cooperation worldwide. Such is the example shown in Before the Flood when DiCaprio visits China and learns that the Chinese public had led many demonstrations against the greenhouse gas emitting companies, demanding change. The government changed its policy to green power and promised to cut back on CO2 pollution. We should also take into consideration that the United States and other Western countries are the most responsible for the creation and acceleration of climate change. We often look towards struggling, socioeconomic countries with huge populations and accuse them of polluting our planet. The truth is that in 2019, the United States emitted 15% of the world’s pollution with a population of 300 million. While countries such as India with a population of 1.3 billion is responsible for 7%. To put it in perspective 1 American’s use of electricity is the equivalent of 34 Indian citizens. The United States is built on the foundations of capitalism, globalism and industrialization and has enjoyed all of the gifts that it comes with; economic prosperity, a rise in an educated population and cutting edge technology. However, the United States could not have accomplished this without the colonization and exploitation of struggling countries in the Middle East, Africa, South America and Southeast Asia. It is sickening to learn that these are the countries who endured  did not benefit from the colonization  All countries must become green powered, however the United States and the rest of the superpowers must take the charge towards this initiative and go the extra mile.

I believe the introduction does an exceptional job at emphasizing the slow degradation of our once flourishing society. Climate change is an issue that has been highlighted for many years but only now, when we are experiencing the direct outcomes of our self-indulgence, do we start making any form of action to stop it. The documentary shows footage all the way back to Clinton’s presidency where an almost prepubescent Dicaprio is spreading awareness, although this was, quite evidently, to no avail. We even get to see warnings of such events from a documentary all the way in 1958, over 60 years ago. Even now, people are resulting to even more dangerous forms of oil extraction, such as tar sand mining, almost as if they’re oblivious to the consequences they’ll have in the future. To top it off, many active politicians, such as Rubio, Cruz, and Trump, directly benefit from this so no legislation will be made to prevent it. 
     <br><br>
I like how Dicaprio is portrayed as just another human being that is eager to learn and spread awareness of all that is happening to our planet. When they go to Greenland and see the hose representing 30 feet of melted ice, that really made me realize the extent warming really has affected us, especially within the last couple of years. They even go to Miami, showing that this is a problem affecting each and everyone of us right now, in our own country. Basically, I feel the documentary does a terrific job at dumbing down the problem for your average viewer, myself included. 
     <br><br>
Nearing the end of the documentary, he revisits his introduction by revealing that the outside of the painting depicts the Earth enclosed in a glass sphere. The sphere, showing the fragility of our planet, is really symbolic of the world. I do, however, like the optimistic view depicted towards the end. We have the power to prevent the third phase from happening.
     <br><br>
 Together. we can prevent, or maybe even reverse, the damage that has been done to our planet.

<p>
The documentary, "Before the Flood" featuring Leonardo DiCaprio states, as the professor notes, that he thinks they may have chosen the wrong guy for the job. I think that this statement is meant to resonate with the viewer, who is most likely an average citizen that is also unsure of their place in the climate crisis. It definitely resonated with me, I fear that because I am not some powerful politician or even a wealthy politician that I am not the right person to be taking care of this mess. However, the rest of the film then explores the place of the entire globe in the climate crisis. 
     <br><br>
I enjoyed this film not only as it was informative but because it was well done. It did not focus too much on either the emotional side of the crisis or the scientific side of the crisis. It was a good in between, where they did not fail to mention the role of industrialized countries in creating this crisis, nor did they fail in attempting to hold them accountable. I also felt like it was able to provide some ways for average people to help!

<p>
I found the documentary “Before the Flood” very interesting and was shocked to see the massive consequences of climate change around the globe. Before watching the film, I had already known that Leonardo DiCaprio was a big advocate for climate change, however at the end of the documentary, I was impressed with how well he has used his platform as not only an actor but also as a UN Ambassador to spread awareness and educate his audience. This documentary not only opened my eyes to the large amount of evidence that proves that climate change is a consequence of human actions, but also introduced me to different aspects of climate change. One thing that I learned from the documentary was that if climate change persists, along with rising global temperatures, certain places in the world will experience dropping temperatures.  
     <br><br>
Something that I found interesting about the climate change issue is how much of a role politics play into how the public sees the problem. It shocks me that corporate officials and other people of power are aware of the impact that their actions create, yet they still attempt to deceive the public and undermine the effects of climate change in order to benefit from fossil fuels.



</p><hr>


<p>
Many people may question whether Leonardo DiCaprio is qualified to hold such a position of power being a UN climate ambassador; however, I think it’s very clear that he truly does know what he is talking about and practices exactly what he preaches. I truly admire him for using his platform and his access to resources to help draw attention to such an important global issue. He is one of the worlds most renowned actors, he’s known all around the world which therefore permits him to make connections and communicate important messages such as climate change with millions of people. I think we can all learn from DiCaprio in the sense that we don’t have to be scientists to want to make a change, what’s important is that we make the effort to stay informed and that we try to be more environmentally conscious.
     <br><br>

The film Before the Flood allowed me to gain a greater knowledge about the ways in which different parts of the world are being affected by climate change as well as how they deal with these effects. The United States is the number one greenhouse gas emitter and it’s devastating to know how many people are suffering and are going to suffer as they pay the consequences for our actions. One thing that really took me as a shock was finding out that Florida governors banned the discussion of climate change when it’s predicted that Miami will be lost within the next decade. However, it is evident that the reason many politicians deny climate change is because  they refuse to stop the burning of fossil fuels since they American economy revolves around it. 
     <br><br>
The part of the film where DiCaprio goes to visit the arctic took me as a complete shock. As a kid whenever I thought about the Arctic I pictured gigantic glaciers with blankets of snow stretching across miles; however, now there’s practically more water than there is snow as the ice has began to melt at an alarming speed. The fact that by 2040 we will be able to sail the North Pole is something I never thought to be possible. 
     <br><br>
I think this film is an excellent start to broadening one’s knowledge on climate change. If there’s one thing I took away from this film is that change is happening and it’s happening fast. If we have the desire to try to help we have to act immediately.

"Before the Flood" is an interesting film as it depicted the different aspects of climate change. Through the voice of Leonardo DiCaprio, we embarked on a journey though the film to see the way different parts of the world were affected by climate change. This film shed light into the topic that many people refuse to notice or simply neglect the fact that it exists because they do not believe in it. Although I did not always believe in climate change, I can not neglect the fact that different parts of the world are being affected by human produced factors. The film touches on the topic of DiCaprio's credibility simply because he is an actor but as you continue to watch the film, one notices that he is quite knowledgeable on the topics that he is talking about but is also willing to learn by visiting different places and speaking to people who have studied the topic. 
     <br><br>


The United States has become an issue of neglecting that it is one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, whereas places like China and India have made the simple change to solar panels because their people have noticed the poor quality of air that is affecting them. Simply within the statistics, the film introduces that 47% of land is being used for food product in the U.S and of that, 70% of that is used for land to feed cattle which is the number one producer of methane when they simply burp into the atmosphere. Climate change is manageable if people but in the work. A way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide being emitted into the earth is to establish a carbon tax which is mentioned in the film and I agree that it would definitely make people produce less carbon if they do not want to pay high amounts of taxes. 

     <br><br>

The movie, in my opinion was well executed and very convincing for those who are in denial of the topic. It also mentioned some misinterpretations of climate change meaning that the world would simply get warmer but as a result it will in fact get cooler in places such as Europe.

The documentary “Before the Flood” did an incredible job of highlighting the dramatic effects our world is facing already in regards to climate change. In the film we follow U.N. messenger of peace, Leonardo Dicaprio, around the world as he witnessed first hand the environments and people who are impacted due to fossil fuel emissions. In our current world it seems that almost everything we do leaves a carbon footprint, be it plugging in our phones or picking out a bag of chips at the grocery store. The US in particular is called out multiple times throughout the film for our extreme carbon footprint and energy consuming lifestyle. Not only are we the second largest producer of fossil fuels but our government is doing next to nothing to stop the progression of climate change. The heads of our environmental committee in congress don’t believe in climate change and refuse to pass climate bills because they profit off of the fossil fuel industries. Meanwhile people living on Islands producing the lowest amount of emissions in the world face the danger of losing their homes to the rising sea levels. 
     <br><br>
I found the section in the film about the impact of the palm oil industry incredibly interesting and alarming. The fact that it's not just about big industries polluting the air but also comes down to us as consumers and the choices we make about what industries to support.



</p><hr>


<p>
The film lead audiences in the eyes of Leonardo Dicaprio, the united nations messenger of climate. He presents himself as someone who knows nothing about the climate crisis and in this way, he learns the climate crisis as we learn it. Our transportation, electricity, and food are from natural gas, oil, and wood, etc. Boreal mountains, fracking coal, offshore digging show the truth in front of my eye. Climate crisis is the most important issue of our time as vice price of the white house Al Gore said. The film takes us to the damages on nature that human beings have made, terrible weather patterns happening on earth, melting ice in the north pole and south pole, denials from technocrats and politicians. However, we still see changes. Through conversation with important officials in Chines, Indian, and U.S. and extraordinary leaders like Elon Musk and a principle in NASA, things are getting much better. The fact is that protecting the earth needs everyone’s efforts. 
     <br><br>


The film does not want us to lose confidence in facing climate change. In contrast, it tells us the truth and when we see what ‘s happening around us, we can face it and figure out a solution. If we take action now, there is a possibility that temperature will recover. Though there is massive destruction made by us before, we cannot give up or continue to know nothing and Countries need to knowingly take actions. The sentence printed on the screen at the end of the movie, “It’s up to all of us.” Although 186 countries have acceded agreement on decreasing 2 degrees Celsius, there is no enforcements or punishments if the leaders do nothing after they return their countries. 
     <br><br>


I was shocked when I heard that the locals living in north Canada said, “the ice is not as strong as before. In the past, ice is blue hard ice but now the ice is like ice cream.” I’ve heard the same. My mom and aunt always said when they were young, rivers and streams are clean and you can see what was happening underwater by your eyes. These are real changes and we have to respond to all of the changes. It is up to all of us.

<p>
Watching "Before the Flood," I was curious as to how Leonardo DiCaprio would be involved in the documentary and what he would bring to it. Following his path of little to lots of knowledge about climate change by seeing where it was taking first hand had me feeling the same emotions of awe and fear for our world. I knew to a certain degree how politics played with climate change, as the film showed how much people were being payed to cause division in the public on the topic of climate change. But I was shown new ways of how our world economy played into climate change, like that of palm oil production and the destruction of tropical forests that are caused to produce small everyday items that truly are not needed. The film was able to show so much in many varying topics that climate change was affecting people, especially those who are poor and in poor countries. The film shows how every part of Earth is undergoing processes that are unnatural and unprecedented. I am furthered upset of how our political leaders continue to treat the American people as unintelligent when it comes to our want of combating climate change. Of course there are so many big issues that go on within the U.S and around the world that need attention, but none of that will matter when the effects of climate change become too irreversible.



</p><hr>


<p>
"Before The Flood" did a great job portraying the severity and horror of the world we ill be living if we do not take action right now. It incorporated facts and statistics as well as anecdotes to help the public understand that we area in a crisis. In the battle against climate change, many people put a disproportionate amount of blame on developing countries contributions, ignoring that we from the United states consume and use tens of times more oil than most other nations. Leo did a good job of mentioning that he, as well as most other United Statesiens are the main perpetrators of climate change.



</p><hr>


<p>
To be honest, I accelerated the play speed in the beginning of the documentary because of the boring opening. But after I saw Leonardo DiCaprio being appointed as the climate change ambassador, I changed the speed back to regular speed. As DiCaprio shows the climate changes around the world and their effect on our society, I begin to view climate change more seriously. 
     <br><br>

This documentary broadens my horizon a lot. It gives me an amount of new knowledge such as the fact about renewable energies and what is really happening globally. What really astonished me and makes me indignant is the fact that there are actually many politicians that tell people climate change is a lie, simply because their are bribed and controlled by the fossil fuel companies. I don’t know whether the situation is really terrible as described in the film. What I do know and have experienced is the decreasing in visibility and warmer winter every year due to air pollution back in my hometown China. 
     <br><br>

As mentioned in the film and by DiCaprio, it is unquestionable that anthropic activities is changing the climate in a harmful and negative way. It is one of the biggest, perhaps the biggest, problems faced by humanity. Although it is sad that there are still a lot of people do not aware or even try to ignore this severe problem, many implements and actions such as the investment in renewable energies in China and the battery of Tesla have already begun. Climate change is an inevitable problem that need to be adjust. Same as Dr. Piers Sellers, I believe that people will gradually take actions when they are aware of the seriousness of this crisis, even though it may takes centuries or more to bring back the original face of this beautiful blue planet.



</p><hr>


<p>
The film “Before the Flood” indicates that excessive use of fossil energy may not only cause global warming, or even if global warming is still controversial, the crisis of energy waste, environmental pollution, resource depletion, and even worsening living conditions reflected by it all exist. of. Perhaps the source of the problem is that we have created too many unnecessary needs for a "modern" and "civilized" lifestyle.
     <br><br>

As a citizen, talking about protecting the environment is no different from politician artsy, but as a person living in this world, we still have to breathe air. This is inevitable. In this case, why not let ourselves breathe cleaner air? We may not be able to run to Greenland to observe the melting of ice caps like Leonardo, to South America to experience the backward life and barren land of the locals, to the Amazon to witness the destruction of a rainforest, but we can change our own eating habits, changing our shopping habits, and changing our electricity habits are like the saying goes that “there is no killing without buying and selling”. Three hundred million people in Africa have no access to electricity, which is equivalent to the total population of the United States, and the average electricity consumption of Americans can provide electricity for thirty-four people in Africa. If we are willing to change, maybe our children and grandchildren will have the opportunity to go fishing in the Arctic. If global warming continues, the entire Arctic is likely to melt into snow by 2060. Remember, the earth is not just belong to us, it belongs to the future.

An Inconvenient Sequel 
     <br><br>
This film focuses more on the political view in climate change by giving us the point of view of former Vice President Al Gore. Al Gore mainly focuses on reducing carbon emissions by switching to clean energy. He shares how he has spent many years trying to make a change in the climate crisis, but there are major setbacks in this area. Al Gore explains that there are many people who simply do not believe in global warming and there are others who do not want to make the change due to the economy. A major argument that arose in the film was that switching to renewable energy would cripple the economy. The film also shared a clip of where Donald Trump states that solar energy would profit in 60 years, but the solar panels would stop working after 10 years and thus making them useless. It is comments like these that raises questions about global warming and its solutions, which causes us to slow down any progress in resolving the crisis. Overall, this film does a great job in informing the audience of the current situation that we are in and convincing people that we need to act now in order to save our planet’s future.

I watched Before the Flood for the first time and found it incredibly informative and interesting. For instance, I had no idea how much larger an American's carbon footprint is by comparison to other countries. One American’s affect on the environment is equal to 34 times as much as one Indian. And 10 times as much as one Chinese person. It just kind of blew me away.  I wasn’t really expecting that much of a discrepancy. 
     <br><br>
Also, I didn't realize how many rain forest and/or trees were being burned in order to make palm oil plantations in Indonesia. There’s something surreal about watching people burn down a forest in order for many of us Americans to enjoy their palm oil. It’s just such a waste. The destructive capabilities of the oil sand pits also seem way more extensive than I would’ve ever imagined. Both the palm oil and the sand oil pits destroy the wildlife and ecosystems all around them and it’s both surprising and depressing. 
     <br><br>
Furthermore, I couldn't believe how much ice has melted off Greenland the past 5-10 years. Over 30 ft! I had no idea that climate change was already this damaging already to our ice caps and how close we really are to reaching a point of no return. It's honestly pretty scary and I hope we can do something before it's too late.

When I watched “Before the Flood”, I got to see an incredibly engaging and interesting documentary about the dangers of climate change. Leonardo DiCaprio’s acting uncovered the truths about climate change as we follow his new discoveries throughout his journey. Before I watched this film, I already knew DiCaprio was invested in battling climate change, but this film made me appreciate what he has been doing even more. His meetings with Obama and government officials proved that he really cared about this topic and wasn’t just promoting himself to make more money.
     <br><br>


To me, the most significant part of this film was when DiCaprio visited India. As the audience, we got to see how far behind the United States is in its efforts to combat climate change and save the planet. Though it is difficult to change something this large-scale, the environmentalist tells DiCaprio about how China has made more efforts for renewable energy because of the people’s strike against the country and government’s excessive use of fossil fuels. However, leaders in fossil fuel productions like the Boch brothers and politicians like Paul Ryan bribe the media to tell the news-watchers that climate change is a hoax. This is how capitalism works in the United States, and although it is morally wrong to spread fake news, it is technically legal. I hope that more people become aware of the truth about climate change and I hope that we all start taking massive efforts to change our actions for the better.

The movie "Before the Flood" is a phenomenal film that explores the climate crisis, starring Leonardo Dicaprio. I was not too excited to watch this, but I ended up being glued to the screen. The film starts off with Dicaprio learning about the climate crisis from Al Gore and immediately wanting to find answers and fix the problem. I was shocked to see the concern from Dicaprio, who is one of the most famous actors on Earth. Dicaprio goes to Greenland to observe an ice sheet. Here, Dicaprio and Jason Box observe that a hose that was once 30 feet in the ice was now on the surface, as the entire ice sheet melted in under 5 years. As a consequence, this released CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and surrounding ocean water. Many issues relating to the climate crisis are addressed in this film informing the audience of important issues going on in our world. This film does a good job of keeping you entertained and raising awareness to a good cause. I also found all the corporate issues interesting and how the greenhouse gases effect our economy and environment in different ways. Some think that its all a hoax, but in reality we have scientific proof of our Earth changing for the worse and politicians need to make changes so we can prevent any further problems from occurring.

Leonardo DiCaprio’s documentary “Before the Flood” offered a well-rounded and insightful view into various aspects of climate change, and how it affects the environment and people around the world. DiCaprio does an effective job of playing down his stardom and fame (and most likely his actual knowledge on the subject of climate change) in order to appear more ordinary to the viewer, which in turn makes us feel as though we are on the same level as him; just someone who cares about the environment and what we are doing to it, what that does to other people, and to figure out how to solve the problem. DiCaprio travels to different places around the world to show how each has been impacted by climate change. Perhaps one of the most striking images, as others have also noted, was in Greenland. Seeing the length of the hose, and knowing that all of it used to go down into the ice, was alarming to say the least. Having that visual helped put into perspective how much damage we are doing to ice sheets and glaciers, and how it will continually get worse until we put an end to our reckless consumption.
     <br><br>

Another example of how DiCaprio is able to put the consequences of climate change into perspective was seeing that in India, people use cow pies as their only source of fuel for cooking and heating. I had no idea that those living in impoverished areas had to resort to using them as a means to live. That, paired with the fact that at the time so many people were without electricity, and seeing how much we consume per person in the United States alone relative to them, was shocking.
     <br><br>

Overall, DiCaprio has done an excellent job at showing how people, places, and animals are all affected by climate change. He offers a broad view of the world, which is helpful when trying to grasp the scope of how much damage is being done. It has made me think harder about my actions, and how they may not only affect my immediate surroundings, but also how it affects those around the world.

This movie helped me learn that Earth is in a much more desperate condition than previously realized. The massive increase in storm strength is terrifying and unprecedented. I understand that an individual contribution is enough to satisfy my consciousness, but a collective effort is imperative for the survival of humanity. I am pessimistic about our current attitudes, but I am optimistic about our outcome once the larger consensus understands the desperation of reality. After this point, humanity can actively solve problems. 
     <br><br>
This film definitely imprinted fear in me. I felt more connected to each victim than ever before. I wish I could reach out and help them, but I could do little more than sit in my bed and wallow. The wildfires, hurricanes, droughts, and organic suffering would provoke a massive sense of insecurity. I didn’t feel safe after watching this film. In the end, I want to do something to limit my contribution to climate change. Whether that includes a reduction in fossil fuel consumption or a more passionate role in policy, I want to do something to help. 
     <br><br>
I believe that the film was effective in delivering the dire threat of climate change; that is, by highlighting the effects of consumerism on the well-being of the planet. Through a series of interviews, that of which include DeCaprio and a few environmentalists/climatologists, one may observe the detrimental impact that American consumption has on the planet. The CO2 yields of an American are 18 times the size of a third-world resident; the product is achieved through excessive use of fossil fuels and a conventional meat-based diet. The outcomes of American behavior have contributed to massive deforestation and ocean acidification; those who rely on those habitats, which include organisms other than humans, have and will continue to perish. Hurricane Sandy, as captured in this film, underscores this desperation. 
     <br><br>
The film intends to acknowledge the radical shift in climate and the detrimental impacts that are soon to occur. Environmentalists and climatologists are already familiar with this reality, I’m sure a few politicians as well, but the American population is quite oblivious; the exception includes coastal residents who experience the torrent of hurricanes and the extreme temperature fluctuations. Most third world residents are familiar with climate change, though each phenomenon is a matter of life and death rather than a mere observation.

Before The Flood does a fantastic job at depicting real images and videos of the effects of climate change. Leonardo DiCaprio’s approach to interviewing people from many different countries, each with unique, varying backgrounds regarding the climate crisis was a wise move. Each of the people DiCaprio interviewed made comments that stood out to me. In particular, DiCaprio’s interview with Sunita Narain from the Centre for Science and Environment in Delhi, India stood out to me. When Narain showcases that the average American at home uses the same amount of electricity as 61 Nigerians at home, I was truly dumbfounded. It is abhorrent how much energy the United States is using unnecessarily, and how much waste the U.S. is producing. We need to change. China, currently the top polluting country on Earth, is taking great strides towards switching from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy sources. If the number one contributor to greenhouse gas emissions can make the change, so can we in the United States.

<p>
While watching “Before the Flood” I couldn’t help but to become frustrated with the fact that our planet is dying more and more by the second due to our actions and yet, most of still don’t do anything about it. When hearing how Dr. Sunita Narain spoke about how the US is the one who has contributed to the issue way more than any other country proved my assumption on how every other country negatively viewed us as well. Here we are burning fossil fuels every single day without a problem while Third World Countries are literally hanging on by a thread, barely getting by. Seeing the comparison from these countries 100 years ago to how they look now is such a sad sight. These once beautiful, green and untouched places are now either on fire, flooded, or much worse. We tend to take things for granted that might not mean anything to us but are seen as extremely valuable in other places around the world. No matter how many changes I make to my everyday life, I think about how many other people are living on this planet and realize the impact I have is miniscule.
     <br><br>
One thing that I found extremely interesting was the cowspiracy they talked about during the film. I had heard people talk about how consuming beef products was bad for the planet but I never knew specifically why. I was in shock when they gave an example of how much land is used to raise cattle compared to how much is used to raise chickens. After that part of the movie, I began thinking about cutting all red meat out of my diet till I saw Ken’s youtube video titled “Before the Flood and An Inconvenient Sequel” where he discusses how the impact of reducing one’s beef consumption was over exaggerated in the film.
     <br><br>
There were several parts throughout the movie where I was at a loss of words but two that really caught my attention was (1) how much money Miami spent on the new pipes/draining system and (2) when the governor of Florida banned the use of the words “climate change.” Miami city spent $400 million on their plans for a solution to the sea-level rise causing the streets to flood. At first I thought it was a good idea until they said it would only help for about 40-50 years. If they’re spending THAT much money, I would hope it would help with the flooding for a longer amount of time. On the other hand, I find it funny and just plain dumb how the governor believes climate change isn’t a real thing and chose to avoid the issue by banning the term within the office. Because of how many other people share this same mentality, I don’t think our planet is capable of being saved.

In the documentary “Before the Flood” many issues about climate change are brought up and how it may affect the human race. The film tells the stories of various experts in different countries and how the impact of our changing climate has impacted them over the last decade. Stories and scenarios such as how the top thirty feet of ice in lower Greenland has melted away or how the city of Miami in Florida is installing a massive pump system to drain their streets whenever then randomly flood and that system is only predicted to sustain them for the next fifty to sixty years. While these are just some of the situations that are happening in different parts of the world, the film also talks about the people who continue to disbelieve that climate change exists and are not looking at the entire set of data. When the film ends however, it gives the viewer ways to improve their lifestyle so that they can do their part in improving the planet and that anyone can do it starting immediately. It stresses the idea that even though things look bad now, they can still be improved so that this crisis can end.

<p>
As the question asked, “if you could know the truth of the climate change, would you want to know”? Maybe we will be scared by the fact of how severe the situation is. Given the fact that, Miami is flooding on the sunny day, but some organizations are still trying to convince the public that the climate change is not that much. The documentary, “Before the Flood”, is about that DiCaprio traveled to different places and talked to many different people like Obama to find the truth of the climate change. A lot of people around the world are trying to let the public know the truth of the climate change, but sometimes I am really confused about what I can do for the earth. I don’t really know what life style I should change into. Many people around me do not really concern about the climate change and they do not even want to know the answer of the first question. Sometimes I just wonder what we should do to influence others.

After watching the film “Before the Flood”, I think this film is worth much more than $3.99 as a renting price. Honestly, I was struggling to pay this “much” money to know more about climate change. However, after I watched it, I’m pretty sure I made a correct choice. 
     <br><br>

“It is up to all of us”, the sentence showed at the end of the film inspired me a lot. Since no matter how many policies and agreements the governments have done, if we people do not change, at the end of the day, we still have to face the catastrophe. In the middle of this film, I was shocked how much effect our daily food contribute to the climate change. I like beef but I did not know the beef is this “expensive”.  The more beef we eat, the more emission of methane through the mouth of cows. It’s not about the money but about how bad we want to accelerate the climate change because of a simple meat choice. Therefore, I think it is the time for people to reconsider their meal plan seriously. 
     <br><br>

Another event that I feel the same way is the problem of the popularity of the American lifestyle all around the world for over one hundred years. This film mentioned the air pollution problem in China. I was born in Nantong city, Jiangsu Province, China. When I was a child, which is exactly the same time of accelerating the reform and open policy. Chinese people wanted a better life. There is no problems about it. On the other hand, as I said, the American lifestyle, is and, was a “perfect” example or goal for people to pursue. And this kind of popularity leads Chinese people to do many things in a similar way as the U.S., which of course including destroying the environment and emit a lot of carbon dioxide and methane during industrialization. The consequences of all these actions is obviously terrible for our environment. Many many cities in China right now are fulfilling with “smoke” and P.M. 2.5. Even though it’s glad to see the government is now acting policies to gradually solve the problems, there is still a long way for Chinese to go in protecting the environment and prevent climate change, not to mention other developing countries like India.
     <br><br>

Finally, this is a fantastic documentary film. Because as it was mentioned in the film, there are still a lot of people do not consider human activities interact with the climate change at all,  I hope more people can watch it. They will be “surprised”.

The film "An Inconvenient Sequel" draws attention to the climate change that is getting to have obvious effects on our daily life and its narrator Al Gore, the former vice president of the United States, leads the talk by filming his journey of combating the climate crisis. There are many interesting points worth discussing in this documentary. One of them is the saying from Pope Francis: "The grave effects of all attacks on the environment are suffered by the poorest". This not only makes me wonder about the reasons behind this but also sharply states the issue with environmental justice. Is it fair, or is it inevitable for the poor to suffer the most while the rich are causing the major problems? I believe that most people would agree with me that human rights are meant to be equal, so it should not let the faults of the rich pouring into the life of the poor. There is no way for the people with the power to judge the life of the poor and even to impose unexpected damage to their life. The same logic works for another justice issue with the conflicting ideas between the developing and developed countries regarding the emissions of greenhouse gases and the blame. As Gore attended the Paris Agreement meeting, he experienced the moment when Indian prime minister Modi declared that India would not cut any emissions because they wanted to maintain economic growth and brought accessible energy uses to three million Indians who suffer from no energy today. To me, any form of imposing ideas or even rules to others is a violation of justice. There is no way for the developed countries to ask India to reduce emissions while they actively kept releasing CO2 and refused to offer financial support to the developing nations in developing renewable energy sources. This is ridiculous. As Professor Ken discussed in the lecture video, 1/4 of the CO2 was put into the atmosphere by the United States while it only constitutes 4% of the total population. It is too much to ask for developing nations like India for a huge cut in CO2 emissions while the developed nations are granted the privilege to emit as much as they want. Unity is the solution here. As we look back to Paris Agreement today, what we see is just a bunch of wordy treaties that are fulfilling the power of treaties, which is no legal and compulsory power. How sad it is when we readjust the Paris goal as our pursuit. As long as the injustice keeps happening, there is no way for democracy and unity to stand out. If the impediments to a perfect justice world are money and power, then it may be the time to beat those wealthy people because we all share the same rights and if the world is going to end the next day, we all suffer no matter how rich we are or how moral we are.

Watching the documentary "Before the Flood" after reading David Wallace-Wells' article "The Uninhabitable Earth" added to my enlightenment and clarified many of the consequences climate change holds. Leonardo DiCaprio did a wonderful job of keeping a relatively mundane issue very interesting throughout the documentary, and I actually enjoyed the entire thing.
     <br><br>

I liked how DiCaprio traveled to multiple destinations all around the world in order to see the effects of climate change first hand, and met up with professionals to learn more about the science behind the phenomenon. His visit to Greenland was shocking, because it looked like what I would have expected, but it was revealed that thirty feet of snow had melted, which was insane. Another part that stuck out to me was his visit to India, which was truly a wake-up call as the lady argued about how detrimental the effects of global warming are and blamed Americans for not doing enough to combat it, while underdeveloped countries are getting ahead of us. As an American, it definitely made me feel guilty, knowing that my country is a model for others but we have let the world down by utilizing fossil fuels and causing harm to countries who don't even contribute to climate change as much as we do. Despite being such an evolved country, climate change is one thing we just can not get right, and it is all because of our political system which allows big donors to corrupt our politicians, preventing any useful policies to form.
     <br><br>

Finally, I liked the idea of a carbon tax, and I believe it is a great way to keep people from excessively using items that can negatively impact our planet.

<p>
I had very low expectations in this documentary because it was made in a very “Hollywood” way; I was expecting a lot of dramatization and fabrication when in fact they actually presented factual evidence and insightful critiques and interviews. 
     <br><br>

My favorite part of the documentary was when he visited India and spoke to Sunita Narain, who gave him a realistic view on third world country’s standing on climate change. It’s very romantic to say, “we all need to change to save the world”, but it’s not very realistic at all to hold the same expectations for all countries to meet those changes. We can look at World Leader’s and see that they pressure smaller nations to make changes that they themselves aren’t willing to make, which is very hypocritical and toxic in the long-run, considering these are the countries that need to be making the biggest changes.

The film “Before the Flood” made it prominent that climate change has unfortunately become an extremely controversial topic despite all the evidence backing up its existence. People are quick to tune out when the topic of climate change comes up. When activists like Greta Thunberg or Leonardo Di Caprio speak out on the issues, people are quick to bring them down, attack them, and comment that they aren’t qualified to speak on the issue. However, it does not take a scientist to see what is going on with the world. Just watch/read the news. Rather than begin to fix the problem, we have resorted to mechanisms that are worse for the environment. Our economy revolves around fossil fuels and companies will do anything to make a profit. Even if it destroys the planet. What we don’t see is people in India losing their livelihoods due to rising sea levels, Islands being taken over by water, tropical rainforest being burned down and exploited for consumer products, and things are only expected to worsen. Large scale storms, droughts, fall of economies, and war for resources are all in our near future if we do nothing. Every-time I read about climate change, I become more pessimistic about our future on this planet. Climate change is not going to have an easy solution. If we, as a nation and as a world, wait until the last minute to fix the issue, no amount of money, resources, or science will be able to save us. It saddens me that the United States has always been seen as the world leader, yet, we aren’t stepping up and being the leaders in stopping climate change.

The film “Before the Flood” in my opinion was fantastic. Leonardo DiCaprio did an outstanding job of showing the threats caused by climate change. Not only did he show his viewers the inevitable consequences, but the action we as humans can and must take against climate change. Leonardo DiCaprio brought up the topic of the climate crisis while at the studio for his movie “The Revenant”. He explains how the movie is meant to portray the dawn of the industrial revolution and the beginning of mass destruction in ecosystems, species populations, and cultures. However, people did this unknowingly back then, but today we still continue to follow the same path at an even larger scale. Throughout the film, DiCaprio visited numerous parts of the world. While in the North Pole, DiCaprio was told that by 2040 the North Pole will be without ice. This was very scary and concerning for me considering I will only be forty years old. These issues are going to impact me and my entire life in every way, shape, and form. In this film, DiCaprio did shed some light on certain things that gave me a feeling of hope for the future. However, I was surprised that Leonardo DiCaprio thought the United Nations chose the wrong person, himself, to be the climate change ambassador. He said despite China being the world’s number one polluter, they are taking big steps to start using clean, renewable energy like wind and solar. This is because people have developed an environmental consciousness since their everyday lives are becoming impacted. They’re gathering in the streets demanding change to help the climate crisis. This is exactly what DiCaprio says the citizens of the United States need to do with their current politicians who have been bought out by fossil fuel companies. They will have no choice but to listen to the polls or they will be voted out. The climate crisis has become highly politicized and has not been seen as an issue where all political parties need to set their differences aside and work together in order to solve the issue. I really did enjoy this film and took DiCaprio’s message that we are in the last panel of Eden and continue to take action to stop the climate crisis to heart. I now feel more informed about climate change after watching this film, and now know what I can do to help reverse the course of destruction we are going down. This film was excellent and used lots of data to provide evidence for its arguments. I would give this film five out of five stars. I highly recommend this film to those who are seeking knowledge about the climate crisis and to those who are skeptical about it.

Fisher Stevens had an interesting idea when it came to raising awareness on climate change: make a movie that revolves around a dominant actor learning about climate change. In "Before the Flood", Stevens hired Leonardo DiCaprio to do just that. DiCaprio was an excellent choice on several accounts. He is charismatic on screen and popular among most audiences, as well as being well spoken and acting as a figure head for the fight against climate change. The film centers on DiCaprio journeying around the world to gain knowledge on the climate crisis. In his journey, he made sure to find information from a variety of sources. From biased places, such as a sand-oil plant, to objective scientific sites, like the one he stopped at in Greenland, DiCaprio's learning came from an eclectic bunch of places. In relaying this information through the movie, DiCaprio found a way to get his messages across the screen in a very approachable tone. While the film has many emotional moments and interviews, it does not slip away from its objective and sincere message towards its viewers: this is a real problem, and we all need to accept that. 
     <br><br>

In getting people to accept the reality of the climate crisis, I feel that this movie is highly effective amongst most audiences. DiCaprio's popularity is enough to drag the film into the center of popular culture, and even enough to keep people watching throughout the documentary. In this regard, DiCaprio was an excellent person to center the movie on. However, a lot of people see it a very different way. Many people, typically people who are under the belief that the climate crisis is modern day myth, look at a well put together film like this and count it off as just another movie. Despite the visual evidence offered throughout the film, a lot of people watching would still critique the validity of it on account of DiCaprio being an actor, not a scientist. Even though DiCaprio was just the face on top of a mountain of well acquired and accredited research, I find many people only take the film at "face value" and refuse to accept the information presented. 
     <br><br>

For those of us who do understand the fact that the film was just a compilation of developed research, it was amazing. Coupling visuals of nature and animals and scenes of negative human-nature interaction, the film does a good job keeping you engaged. By engaging its audience so well, it causes its message to be well heard. Among us who accepted the message, scenes such as a once buried in ice 30-foot pole now lying on the ground are upsetting, alarming, and successful in riling its viewers into action. Calling us to vote for better politicians, do our personal part in reducing our own carbon footprint, and to better handle the "puppet of the people" we call the government, the film inspires us through its use of strong imagery and through its role modeling of DiCaprio.

“Before the Flood” is a documentary film mainly narrated by Leonardo, who is exploring the answer to the climate change while providing information for audience. Throughout the journey to some most important country in the world, Leo reveals the truth that climate change is happening, and it’s getting worse. While there are tons of scientific data and fact to support this idea, climate change denialism still exists. These group people are mainly funded or supported by oil industry and those companies that will be negatively affected if environmental-friendly policies are applied. What impressed me most is the conversation between Leo and the Indian interviewee. When Leo points out that if all Indian have access to coal, the scale of emission of green house gas would be extremely massive. But the reaction of that lady really shocks me. She is brave enough to point out that US fails to make a good lead for the world. In other word, if US, as the biggest economic entity, are not able to shift from fossil fuel to renewable, why does it ask other countries which consume much less than US to contribute big amount of money to achieve the shift? 
     <br><br>
I feel really to witness how people and animals, especially those contribute least to climate change are suffered from the greatest impact of climate change. Moreover, I’m very angry to know that people are rejecting to accept climate change because their profit will be influenced. I am curious that have they ever considered that the consequence will ultimately fall on everyone. But I strongly believe that human being can overcome the crisis even some politics and company are the obstacles since more and more people are getting educated and acting for our future.

I remember when this film originally came out and the buzz it generated. I watched it at the time and came away amazed about how little the public is actually aware about the climate crisis. After watching it again, I came away feeling the same exact shock. .By using a name as big as Leonardo DiCaprio, the film makers were able to generate excitement about this issue. They then did a great job following DiCaprio across the globe, showing different parts of the world experiencing different issues. I was particularly surprised when they revealed that by 2040, you will be able to fly over the North Pole without seeing any ice. By presenting facts like that, DiCaprio really helps the audience understand how dire the situation is. The other message of the film, the responsibility we have as individuals to act on this situation, was communicated equally well. Hearing about the disinterest powerful people around the world have for this issue should motivate the public to act, and showing steps countries like China are taking with their renewable energy strategies should serve as inspiration of possible solutions we can take to start saving the planet.

Before watching the documentary “Before the Flood” I was slightly skeptical about how informative it would be. It features Leonardo DiCaprio and therefore I was unsure of how much real information could be in it, however I was proven wrong. This documentary really intrigued me, specifically parts where they talked about attainable solutions to climate change that are still possible, as climate change in general can be a very daunting thing when you consider the potential outcomes. The knowledge I now have about certain renewable energy that is being progressively built upon to become more usable makes me hopeful for the future of the Earth, however it also makes me aware of the energy that we are currently using that is detrimental to the environment. At the end of the documentary I realized the use of DiCaprio, Elon Musk and other well known people actually helped accentuate the main points because they became reputable as the information became more and more clear. Elon Musk in particular was very interesting to me as the technology he has created to start moving us away from fossil fuels is genuinely revolutionary. Overall this documentary helped open my eyes up to the realities of climate change not just in the US, but around the world.

I completely agree! My learning of DiCaprio's role in "Before the Flood" lead to septicity of the factual density of the film. But I too was soon intrigued by the plot and reachable solutions that remain possible with the right steps. I also appreciated the appearance of Elon Musk as I believe it really did help accentuate the points of the film since Musk has already made very serious contributions to the energy-saving industry.

Climate change is always a global problem that need to be faced and solved as soon as possible. In the movie, Before the Flood, the plot gradually introduces the topic to audience attractively. Also, it is good to know that Leonardo DiCaprio joined this movie which will definitely attract more people to pay attention to this problem because of his influential. However, it is depressive to know that climate change is not able to be fixed in our purpose because of the human usage of the whole world. For example, in Indian which is the country who need a large number of coals to transfer into electricity, one of the main sources in the world. The reason why there are so many countries including Indian is because of their lack of asset to afford new kinds of source. In this way, coals will produce tons of pollutions in one day. Also, not only coals, but also grazing would cause significant scales of damage to the climate, but it is not able to be avoided as we want. Therefore, climate change is not a simple topic that only need to be discussed and fixed easily, because it is a long-term global problem that need to be observed and waited for a right time to solve.

The film, Before the Flood, did an amazing job executing the perspectives of climate change around the world, while getting to know another side of Leonardo DiCaprio. When receiving the title: Messenger of Peace on Climate Change, many citizens viewed him as a joke, just like how they viewed climate change. Regardless, if he had the credentials or not, Leonardo had a great enough passion to chase down the truth on climate change. 
     <br><br>
Through this documentary he takes us to China, India, Canada Arctic, Islands, Miami, and many other places, in order to show us how they are being affected by global warming, I found it interesting how the under developed countries are doing their own contributions in order to face global warming, whereas America isn't doing anything. On the contrary, as we learned from the previous film, politicians refuse to talk about global warming. China is still relying on fossil fuels, being the greatest polluter in the world, but they are going towards a greener outlook with support of their government. The secretary of general mentioned an interesting analogy, he said earth being just a small boat in the massive universe and if the boat is sinking, then we will all sink together, meaning that we need to all do something together in order to avoid sinking. However, with out government denying global warming, then I guess we're all going down. Politicians refuse to pass a bill on climate change because of the fact that the fossil fuel companies fund their career. 
     <br><br>
I agree with the Carbon Tax, it's a great idea to tax any kind of activity that would put carbon in the atmosphere because if you tax something it makes people want to consume less of it. Which also leads to a tax shift to something, like the film mentioned government maybe can decrease payroll taxes and increase the carbon ta. It may not be the solution to eliminate climate change altogether but it is a start. And after watching these films, they have definitely made me want to vote for politicians that are not afraid to stand up for the environment all together.
     <br><br>
Overall, seeing through Leonardo DiCaprio's trips across the world, made me worry for our future. It was harsh to see the way global warming has affected other parts of the world, and it was sad to hear that there might not be snow in the years to come. What made me lose hope for our future is the fact that no matter how much we talk about it, or we fight against it, the politicians refuse to even talk about the matter. They might have passed the Paris Agreement, but it's sad that as of today our president has taken us out of the Paris Agreement. However, I am so proud that the people of America haven't given up the fight and want to continue with the Paris Agreement.

After watching the film “Before the Flood”, I remember one sentence that a person said the people in Fiji contribute the least amount of greenhouse gases, but they were affected the worst by the climate change. It is really sad that people in Fiji did almost nothing but their lives got worse, while the people in U.S. government, the main country that emits CO2 and methane, still trying to mislead the citizen that the climate change, the global warming is a joke. When I saw president Donald Trump said “its freezing right here, we need some global warming”, I was really angry. Global warming is a serious topic, as a president, you can’t talk it as a joke. Meanwhile, the climate change that caused by human is not only global warming, but the suddenly bad weather. As a Chinese, I knew that China is the biggest country that contribute the greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. It is harrowing that the weather in Beijing is threatening everyone’s life. But I was also thankful to the Chinese government that they take this problem seriously. The Chinese scientist said in the movie that “If China can transform to solar energy country, then the rest of the world can”. The Indian scientist said “US should act as the leader to push the world to take action, and we can tell our government that US is doing it, so do we”. Those words told me that as the big countries, and the people lived in these countries, we should take action, not by tomorrow, not by tonight, RIGHT NOW!

In the film, “An Inconvenient Sequel,” Al Gore continues his fight against climate change by teaching people about it and influencing international policy. I really enjoyed watching this movie and particularly enjoyed learning more about Al Gore. I had heard of him before I watched this movie but wasn’t exactly sure who he was. After this film, I genuinely admire him and want to learn more about his initiatives.

One thing that struck me about the film was when he mentioned that on a global basis, the world gets more energy from the sun each hour than the entire global economy uses for an entire year. While I know that a change in consumption would be more efficient in mitigating climate change than alternatives for fossil fuel would be, I still find this information shocking. If we would better utilize renewable energy sources that we have on our planet, the world could have access to clean energy. This is important because in places like China, for example, the life expectancy has gone down five and a half years because of air pollution and the Beijing mayor said that the city is not livable. Even so, there are many parts of China where it is cheaper to get electricity from solar and wind. This is crucial because renewable energy has to be a viable option for places like Beijing where air pollution is making the city unlivable. 
     <br><br>

He also talked about how warmer temperatures speed up the incubation rate inside a mosquito, which results in an explosion in the number of cases for diseases. Furthermore, it has spread to Miami, Florida. What caught my attention was when he said that for the first time in history, pregnant women have been advised not to go to part of the United States. This is mind boggling to me because the US has always had a reputation for being a place of safety and development and now it's dangerous to go to Florida because of the warmer temperatures. 
     <br><br>

Finally, the ending of the movie was really empowering. To think of the climate change movement as the next abolition movement or the next women’s suffrage movement really made me think of how big and impactful this movement really is. I would definitely recommend this film to a friend considering how powerful it is.

In watching the film “Before the Flood” I was sadden by the video clips of current destruction that is covering our planet. Including the deforestation of the amazon rainforest, the polar ice caps melting, crops in India being underwater, and the displaced people across the world. This film beautifully highlights all the ways that fossil fuels have caused massive destruction. Though these images are heartbreaking, it is necessary in convincing those that deny climate change. This film highlighted that the media has played a roll in convincing the public that climate change is not real. They even went as far as to ridicule Dicaprio about his qualifications. The film mentioned other scientist that came forward with scientific proof about climate change and they have been met with equal criticism. This tactic of name calling these individuals is to discredit them and therefore discredit everything they speak of. I think using someone like Leo is a great way of teaching the audience everything they need to know about climate change and that its not just water levels rising but a domino effect of destruction. They discussed this briefly when mentioning the tipping point and what is happening in Greenland. Greenland is melting and in turn becomes self-heating. This is the biggest fear. That we get to a point of no return. I think the best part about the film is the ending where they gave suggestions about what we can do to help. This included changing our consumption patterns, voting, and looking into a carbon tax. 
     <br><br>
I think one of the most alarming topics discussed in the film is the corruption of the government. Particularly in there efforts to create this divide in the American public. We have elected government officials that are taking money from big corporations that make their money off of burning fossil fuels. I think it’s important that the U.S be more proactive like China. By being transparent about information and turning to wind and solar power.

I was fascinated by the journey Leonardo DiCaprio invited viewers on in the film, “Before the Flood.” He relates to the viewers by immediately displaying his vulnerability and sharing the criticism he faced for becoming the new United Nations messenger of peace for climate change. The film continuously incorporates Leonardo’s struggles while participating in the fight against climate change and shows the many personal and wide-scale decisions involved in the fight. 
     <br><br>

I was shocked at the amount of denialism about climate change that still exists today. People in the media described Leonardo as the perfect person to represent a fake idea because of his actor status. News casters blatantly mocked scientists and real data in front of our entire population. Officials in Florida were banned from using the word climate change in 2011! Michael Mann was vilified and received death threats for posting a graph displaying climate change patterns. It became very clear as the film progressed that the biggest obstacle in the way of our progress as a planet is disinformation, mostly financed by huge fossil fuel companies desperately trying to maintain their industry. 
      <br><br>

I noticed a couple solutions to the problem that I liked in the film. China exposes factory data to the public and to the media. By including the people, individuals become infuriated and determined to be a part of the solution. I also thought a carbon tax was an incredibly smart idea. It would not be increasing taxes, but rather adding a tax on carbon and decreasing taxes elsewhere. This way, people are nudged in the right direction without having to put their busy lives on hold to consciously make better decisions for our planet. Additionally, if people can cut their beef intake even just in half, it will significantly reduce methane emissions. 
     <br><br>

This documentary was incredibly intriguing and many moments stuck with me, including the statement that our children might look back to us in the future and realize we could have prevented devastation if only we had the political will.

“Before the Flood,” is set up in a perfect way for teaching climate change in an exciting manner. In the documentary, main character Leonardo DiCaprio wants to learn the truth about climate change. He travels the world visiting a range of important figures and learning about the various effects of climate change. This approach allows the audience to learn alongside the protagonist instead of taking a traditional documentary approach where the facts are told directly to you. In my opinion, this adds a story element that is able to create a stronger emotional connection between the viewer and the issues at play. My favorite scene in the movie is when DiCaprio has an encounter with Elon Musk. In this scene, DiCaprio questions Musk about how many factories it would take to keep the world running on sustainable energy. They come to the conclusion that the task is actually more manageable than expected, especially if a “carbon task” was implemented. What makes this scene my favorite is that it presents a sense of hope through communal effort. The movie presents a call to action and gives direction for our solution. Another important part of the film is when DiCaprio travels to Beijing and India, where he discovers the various effects climate change is creating for developing nations. I was shocked to realize just how bad the situation is getting for countries like Bangladesh. Nations like the U.S and other first world countries benefit heavily at the cost of these nations, which sounds very familiar looking at our history. Smog and unbreathable air, or the lack of energy in India, are things that will only worsen if we continue to ignore the presence of climate change. Overall, I found the documentary quite moving and enjoyed the format they used to present the truth about climate change.

While watching the film, Before the flood, I honestly would not have clicked on it and watched it without taking this class. Seeing though that Leonardo Dicaprio was the protagonist of the film I was intrigued to see how he would convey the information to the audience. I ended up watching this with another person and this one hour and thirty minute film turned into a three hour one, but for good reason. We would end up pausing the film and begin discussing what we had just learned. When I learned that cows produce that much methane in comparison to chicken I decided to limit if not eliminate the intake of beef in my diet. Knowing now that palm oil is detrimental to the environment has led me to be more careful about what I buy. I know that it won’t solve the problem but everything helps. I’m a little ashamed that I didn’t put two and two together, but when I realized how much energy we used and it directly correlated to the amount of pollution that occurs I was astonished. Even If everyone were to switch over to electric vehicles, we would still need to make sure that the electricity powering those vehicles came from a renewable source. I just don’t think with our current leaders of the United States, that would be a possibility. Lastly, when Leonardo Dicaprio was flying over the oil sands, and he said it looked like Mordor, not only was that my favorite part due to the reference, it was also a scary reality.

The film, "Before the Flood," was a very interesting documentary about climate change. Leonardo DiCaprio is a very famous actor, and he is known to be a die hard environmentalist. I have personally heard of some backlash against Leonardo DiCaprio saying he is an actor who doesn't know anything about the environment, so seeing this, where DiCaprio travels and learns all this new information about the state of our planet, is very cool and changes my perception of how much he knows. The "familiar" face of DiCaprio addressing such a severe problem allows the huge concept to be understood better and also draws in a larger audience. This is very important since the material he brings to light is absolutely needed to be seen by the general public. 

     <br><br>

What is scariest to me about ANY of the climate crisis is the way people are able to ignore it for their own benefit, and there are many examples of how this ignorance is the reason why nothing is changing in the documentary. Yes, I am scared of the fires, and the hurricanes, and the sea level rise, and all these things that are coming, but the scariest thing is the greedy human nature that is causing all of it. Without this, we could fix our climate crisis. In high school, I did a project about palm oil and how it is destroying some of the last rainforests on Earth, so seeing the footage of the trees being burnt down to make way for the palm oil to be harvested in order for companies to make more profit was reminiscent of this project and stuck in my head as an example of the horrors caused by human greed. The way companies can do these horrors and get away with it is mind-boggling. When they showed just a few of the many companies that benefit from palm oil extraction, it is so sad to recognize them and know that I have bought their products. There should be more news exposing these companies for their practices so people really know which companies to avoid.
     <br><br>


Now to answer the question of whether or not I would want to know the truth of the climate crisis, I would say yes and no. I would say no because ignorance truly is bliss, and the climate crisis is such a near and catastrophic event, that knowing about it can make it hard to focus on other parts of your life, knowing that there is a much bigger problem at hand. Yet, without knowing, nothing can be done. So my absolute final answer is 100% I would like to know the truth and I'm glad I am learning the truth, in order to stop it while we can. The planet needs everyone to answer this question with yes in order to spur us into action, but I can see how many people are in denial of this horrific crisis in order to maintain the ignorance.

Just one of of the things that weighed on me about "Before the Flood" was how drastically politics and the environment have deteriorated in the years following the release of the film. Less than a month after DiCaprio's documentary premiered, a climate change denier was elected to arguably the most powerful office in the world, and began to use this power to mock and disrupt efforts to protect the environment, (DiCaprio briefly shows a clip from the election trail) rolling back the minimal regulations intended to slow damage in the U.S. and withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, a major point of hope DiCaprio focuses on. "Before the Flood" focuses on world-wide and local environmental disasters, but in the years following its release, Wildfires have devastated regions in DiCaprio's home state of California, New Delhi has experienced horrifying new levels of pollution, regions of India and the Amazon experienced severe burning seasons, and Atlantic hurricanes have been more costly and frequent than ever before. A history of only three years has in some major ways made viewing this film far more discouraging.
     <br><br>

A face of hope for me in this experience was Piers Sellers, the astronaut who spoke to DiCaprio towards the end of the film. As the weight of the crisis humans face settled once again on my shoulders, I watched a man confront death (Sellers passed away shortly after the film released) and the climate crisis with the same kindness and optimism. Seeing someone accept inevitable but terrifying situations with compassion and hope was steadying to my experience, and I think wise on the part of the filmmakers.

While watching the documentary “Before the Flood”, I found that following Leanardo DeCaproio was extremely interesting. The documentary visits multiple counties and interviews many influential people throughout the world. Because of this, the documentary was able to address the eternity of climate change and not just one aspect. The film gives the viewer a good idea of what is happening to the world in places we may not be seeing every day. The effects of climate change are already very present and this film shows that. I found it interesting how there was a clip of Bill Clinton when he was president addressing questions about climate change. This immediately made me think about why it has taken us so long. Climate change has been a known issue for years and it seems as if it has taken until recently for the issue to be taken seriously. In addition to this, I think that it was important for the film to address the fact that many people don't think climate change is occurring and “people are not capable of changing the environment”. While I knew some people didn't believe in climate change I didn't realize just how many were involved in our government and that many of them were even profiting from fossil fuels. 
     <br><br>
I also found that the film was inspiring, it mentioned things an individual could do to help make positive changes to fight climate change. There are simple things like switching from eating beef to chicken. I also didn't know that there was room for repair. This means we could have the chance to reverse the damages we have already done, eventually. Lastly, as DeCaprio states, it’s not “hopeless”, we still have time we just have to take action now.

<p>
"Before the Flood" explores the affects climate change will reap in different parts of the world and the subsequent need for action that is often fought against. Something I never understood until watching this regarding the issue is how people claim that they "don't believe in climate change" as if it were a religion and not scientific fact. The film explained how people hold this "belief" because they do not want to face the reality of disaster that climate change will soon entail, or they are getting paid by environmentally hazardous greedy corporations to promote such disinformation. 
     <br><br>

The film also touches upon the numerous aspects of climate change. It explains how Greenland and the Arctic may melt entirely, causing droughts and global sea levels to rise. The drastic increase in 4 degrees celsius will result in extinctions followed by collapsed ecosystems, such as the loss of 50% of all coral and the subsequent destruction of coral reef ecosystems that feed over a billion people. It also glosses over how cows are so environmentally hazardous due to the methane they produce. It also touches on the ways individual ordinary people can help lessen the affects of climate change, by eating less red meat, boycotting certain products such as those containing palm oil as it drives deforestation, and voting for politicians that support an aggressive approach to taking climate action.
     <br><br>

The film also discusses an important concept briefly discussed in lecture the other day, as it mentioned that those who contribute the most to climate change face the least consequences in comparison to those who contribute the least yet suffer the most because of climate change. Poor people and poor countries will suffer the most from climate change and it has already begun. This is what helps make climate change a very pressing social issue in addition to an environmental one, as its harsh consequences are not and will not be experienced equally around the globe.

<p>
In "Before the Flood," I found the structure of the film to be much more persuasive than the content. While the film did showcase the drastic effects of climate change, the way the issue was portrayed made the movie much more captivating. As Ken said in his video, the film starts by showing a protagonist. Leonardo DiCaprio is an actor that many people know and love. By centering him as the main focus of the film, they have immediately captivated an audience that might watch simply because DiCaprio stars in the documentary. DiCaprio also mentions early on in the film that he wants "to do everything [he] can to learn more about this issue." By DiCaprio stating this, he essentially tells viewers that he cares so we should as well. As Ken motions, DiCaprio is like more well versed in the issue that the film paints him to be. However, I think that sort of "deception" is a way to keep viewers interested in the film and open to learning about the issue. Another big aspect I like about the film is the emphasis it places on showing the effects of climate change in other parts of the world. I feel that oftentimes we as Americans and westerners can hide behind ignorance when discussing issues that don't directly affect us. One example is the film showing the melting ice in Greenland and how all the melting ice has resulted in rising sea levels. After showing us Greenland, the film immediately goes to news coverage that states, "Miami, New Orleans, Boston, and Long Beach, California may be doomed to fall victim to ever rising sea levels." which emphasizes the drastic impacts that our actions have on the climate which results in negative consequences in other parts of the world which ultimately affects us. This is important since "developed" countries are largely to blame for climate change and also have the resources to aid the crisis.

<p>
Watching the film, Before the Flood, I was astonished to see the amount of climate disasters going on and the amount of action people are taking to combat the issue. I, personally, enjoyed the connection to the painting, Garden of Earthly Delights. The connection foreshadows the events to come if humanity does not tackle down the issues present in this day and age. Watching the film, DiCaprio exposes the audiences to the many effects of climate change throughout the world such as the artic where the ice melted a substantial amount and the rainforest down south that is being destroyed by the cattle industry and the oil industries. DiCaprio does a good job of raising awareness on the issue both scientifically and politically. As it is mentioned in the film, DiCaprio was the messenger of peace for the united Nations and it shows the journey that nations across the globe are going through to combat the issue of changing climates. Overall, the film primarily raised awareness. 
     <br><br>

The film could have used more calls of action other than the ending. However, I think that this was not the purpose of the film. I think the main target of the film was to get people riled up on the issue of climate change by exposing them to the amount of disasters occurring around the globe. The ending was just a starter for DiCaprio to encourage the people of the world to continue to fight against climate change.

<p>
In the film, “Before the Flood”, I am in awe after watching the whole film because I always thought I am at least aware of what is happening in our world in terms of Climate Change. The film pictures the underrated issues such as burning fossil fuels, sea level rising, melting glaciers, and extinction of species. In addition, The whole film is not simply introducing us to the main core of the course but also, encapsulates what is happening right at this moment, even as I write this comment, the ongoing destruction of our planet due to carbon emissions caused by humanity. Personally, I feel immensely guilty of contributing to the devastating issue of Climate Change. I felt like living in this great free country, spoiled me in multiple areas of my life that I took it for granted, not knowing what actually is happening within our planet.
     <br><br>


Additionally, I found myself disappointed in our political leaders for not seeing the bigger picture of humanity throughout the globe. Some of our political leaders believe that climate change is a hoax and that they continue to reject it. because they are big contributors and money hoarders of fossil fuel power stations. I felt embarrassed that we have leaders and even followers throughout the world that disagree with the issue of Climate Change because of capitalism. For these reasons, we faced drawbacks in repairing our Planet. However, it is not too late for humanity to survive, Like Obama’s shift of view regarding Pride community, The public could still reinforce possible solutions to Climate Change by doing simple but impact actions like switching their lightbulbs or switching their dietary. In doing so, like what Gregory Mankiw said, the leader would be heavily influenced by the public. Humanity would need to work together in order to heal our planet.

The documentary “Before the Flood'' reflects the inaction of the Government, the Public, and big companies about climate crisis. What's worse, someone is trying to hind the truth. For example, some fossil fuel industries spend millions of dollars per year just for proving the public that climate isn't change in order to keep making profits. Leonardo DiCaprio, the Protagonist of the film, start traveling around the world to seek for the truth about climate change. Though he is not a expert in climate, which is partly the reason why so many people doubt and against his view about the climate crisis, he did the job that are far more better than some scientists. He explored and showed the truth of climate change to us through a one hour and a half film. 
     <br><br>


For my part, I learned about what situation we are in and shocked about how terrible the outcome can be by our daily habit, such as eating animal products. It is a shame that the alarm is posted by non-experts instead of whom understand the truth but choose not to say just because it will hurt their personal interests. We should stop question how professional Leonardo DiCaprio or Al Gore is but respect and focus on their painstaking research results.


</p><hr>

<p>
I think of Before the Flood as very interesting, educating and inspiring. Being a well known public figure whose expertise lies in acting, Leonardo DiCaprio has demonstrated great humbleness that he is willing to learn about a field that he’s not an expert in: climate change. The documentary did an amazing job in casting DiCaprio, who stood as a representative of the ordinary global citizens, asking questions, investigating problems, and dissecting issues from various perspectives. This was especially effective since it helps to shorten the distance between the viewers and the producers, evoking the audience to deeply realize the closeness of climate change to their everyday lives, and possibly inspire them to take actions instead of staying out of responsibilities.
     <br><br>


This documentary also succeeded in highlighting the visual evidence of climate change. For example, DiCaprio visited the Arctic himself alongside climate scientist, and observed the hose which was used to be 30 feet under ice sheets. Visually revealing the scars left by climate change was no doubt a direct way to confront the unrestrained behaviors of humankind. Another shocking example was the Indonesian rainforest, where the companies would intentionally set fire in order to extract palm oil that grants them tremendous profits. Once again, the documentary was very effective in visually presenting the different aspects that accelerate climate change, which served to inform the viewers of how severely our environment is wronged by us. Although it breaks my heart to see some people still being skeptical about the reality and severeness of climate change, the documentary sincerely foregrounded the urgency of our involvement and action. 
     <br><br>


As an ordinary individual, I absolutely felt more awake and less confused by learning the many specific disasters in climate change. In addition, it is also very nice to see DiCaprio willing to use his influence as a celebrity to raise awareness of this issue. A very honorable approach.

<p>
In the film, “Before the Flood,” Leonardo DiCaprio’s introduction saying they may have been wrong to choose him as a climate change ambassador made him look both humble and relatable to the audience. This portrayal is successful because the viewers (generally) aren’t experts about the effects of climate change and want to learn, he makes himself seem like an amateur so the audience can relate to him more as the protagonist of the film. 
     <br><br>

I enjoyed the film Before the Flood. It features interviews of leaders and other people around the world which offered various valuable perspectives about climate change. DiCaprio emphasized the fact that people knew about climate change half a century ago and let it get to the point it’s reached today anyway. OK Boomers. Our dependency on fossil fuels needs to decrease dramatically if we expect to save the polar bears from drowning and prevent all of the ocean’s currents from changing.

Film: "Before the Flood"
     <br><br>
The film was a very interesting one in which Leonardo DiCaprio educates us about current issues around the globe all related to climate change. I really enjoyed the approach he took with this documentary of seemingly going out to experts on the climate crisis and learning from them. The way he uses his star power to do this is effective for his followers and serves to relate to people like me, as he too wants to learn more about this severe issue in society. The film explores many interesting points with endless debates being made about them. The ones I found most interesting and in a sense alarming were when he described how the polar ice was currently melting at a very fast rate, and that affects the climate in those areas, as well as species living in the seas there. The film also genuinely surprised me in the way many politicians spoke about the climate crisis. I found it dismaying how many politicians are ignoring this grave issue and not opening their eyes at trying to fix this. The corruption by big companies also alarmed me as they are also ignoring the climate crisis and would rather seek to make profit rather than use their power and influence to create a positive change for society. Overall this film did a great job in educating us about the severity of climate change in the near future, as from this point forward it will only get worse.

<p>
The film "Before the Flood", in my personal perspective, is a quite success, since it successfully catches the audiences' eyes and letting the audiences know the severity of climate change. First is because the actor, Leonardo Dicaprio, is a well known, prestigious actor in Hollywood liked by millions of people, who also won Oscar prize. Therefore, choosing him as a leading character can do attract many audiences to increase the audience measurement, which make this film become the 11th documentary in history. Second, it evidently expresses the severity of what climate change brings to human, such as the size of ice sheet in North Pole decreases dramatically. This is the fastest and most effective way to call citizens for action, to address this puzzle. In addition, Al Gore has started climate training first in the U.S., and I can personally see the effect it brings to local citizens: the sky is become bluer than before, and I hope it can help my nation, our world, to bring original beauty back to Earth.

</p><hr>

<p>
“An Inconvenient Sequel” by Al Gore is a well shot film that puts the viewer face to face with the concrete realities of climate-change. The images of the melting ice-sheet in the earlier parts of the film are quite instructive and worrisome for the future of the planet. The speakers are intelligent and manage to explain science-y phenomenon with accessible and understandable jargon. The movie reconciles scientific scenarios with a more democratic medium in an attempt to inform a more mass-audience. This is important as scholars alone cannot be the only ones to grasp the urgency of the climate crisis.



</p><hr>

<p>
I think Before the Flood is a good movie if you don’t know anything about climate change. Personally, as someone who already knows about the climate crisis, I found it uninspiring. DiCaprio shows us the problem, without taking a lot of responsibility and without giving clear and meaningful calls to action. I think telling people to “change what they consume” without being clear about exactly how is ineffective. I find it extremely difficult to watch a millionaire talk to other millionaires about what all of the public should be doing. The truth is clear: a few people have created this problem for everybody. To me, DiCaprio embodies the spirit of colonialism when he speaks to the Indian official, claiming that the United States will not change and we now rely on the developing countries to meet and exceed our expectations for them to fix our problem.
     <br><br>
Before the Flood is also hard to watch because we now live in a United States that has elected President Trump, a climate denier and outright xenophobe, to office. How does the Paris Agreement hold now that the United States has withdrawn? Once again, we have moved backward instead of forward. I would like to see a film that gives us real options for change. Before the Flood starts to address these issues, like switching to a plant-based diet and increasing our civic engagement and voter turnout, but I don’t think it is strong enough. We cannot survive with the systems we have now, because almost all of our systems rely on destroying the planet. This movie begins to address this, but seems to be a message that still upholds the current power systems.

<p>
The film "Before the Flood" is a very well put film in perspective of informing the general public of the damaging effects that climate change is causing to our planet. The film had a very strong sense of urgency and calling to the public to help make a change in lessening the speed of climate change. I personally did not know of the amount of contribution to carbon emissions that factory farming has, especially the beef industry. Eating beef is such an everyday part of society and my culture that its hard to think of not eating in our everyday foods, but through this film I was able to comprehend the gravity of the issue and that I should anything in my power to lower my carbon footprint. Through this film I realized the great luxuries that we have here in the United States and that those luxuries come with a price. Our everyday use of electricity, eating beef, automobiles and air travel cause such a great amount of carbon emission into the air. The truth being that in order to really stop the acceleration of climate change and not allowing the increase in world temperature we, as in mainly people of first world countries ,have to change our way of life.

     <br><br>

Living in a country such as the United States, you take for granted how you live your everyday life and we don't really take into perspective where even our day foods, cosmetics and forms of travel come from and the great impact it has on the world. For example, I didn't know of the damages that come from the business of palm oil and its correlation to deforestation in Indonesia and how it would be very hard to stop using it because it is practically in almost everything we consume of daily. Because, of this way of living in this country, we are the second nation to emit the most carbon dioxide into our atmosphere and we are not even the country with the highest population. Multiple countries all around the world with higher population emit lees carbon into the air than we do. This fact should make the people of the United States should be the one leading this change of life and towards a direction of less carbon emissions instead of holding it to to her countries to do it first.

I really appreciate the director that invite Leonard to be in the film. He as a famous movie star can lead many people to pay attention to the problems. As a documentary film, Before the Flood shows different aspects of the Earth in different continents. Leonard witnessed the environmental problems that happen among people. The action of diminishing the crisis and demonstrating the importance of awareness of the crisis has come to my mind. The most impressive way to alarm people is to let them see the problems. This film makes people see the global warming and the problems even take place in their home cities. In China, the environmental problems have become very serious, the sky are not longer blue. The air that breath is full of pollution. The film is very informative. I appreciate the way that Leonard advocates people to get known the severity of the crisis and try to control them. He as a representative really leaves many unique information in my mind.

<p>
After watching Before the Flood, I continue to become increasingly frustrated with the amalgamation of climate-related crises across the planet. DiCaprio does a fantastic job by portraying a learner's persona by taking the viewer along his journey of discovery. It allows the viewer to relate to his sheer curiosity, as opposed to having an intellectual protagonist instead. He effectively exposes the political and corporate greed that dominates the fossil fuel sector, and is able to undermine the greed-driven arguments behind climate change deniers.
     <br><br>

The documentary does a very good job of relating the numerous environmental crises caused by a warming planet to a general root cause of government inaction. The severity of the inaction becomes very clear when DiCaprio speaks with Professor Michael Mann, who was publicly villified for deseminating a "hockey-stick" graph depicting the significant spike in global temperatures. The amount of sheer hatred Mann recieved from his scientific findings only further exposes how corporate interests will not hesitate to deny the facts.
     <br><br>

In conversation with Dr. Sunita Narain from India, the ignorance is even clearer. While developing nations such as India are dealing with larger issues such as overpopulation and poverty, switching to renewable energy is not a top priority. Thus, the US is expressing its ignorance by asking "that the world's poor should move to solar," because, ironically, as Narain says, "I would really have liked the US to move to solar. But you haven't." 
     <br><br>

This pattern of ignorance repeats itself throughout the film, and shows how the general cause of the climate crisis boils down to a lack of action. As Dr. Piers Sellers says, "if we stopped burning fossil fuels right now, the planet would still keep warming for little while before cooling off again." While completely halting the burning of fossil fuels across the planet is very implausible as a short-term goal, it only shows how there lies potential for change outside of what politicians and corporate interests are comfortable doing right now.

The film, “Before the Flood,” is an excellent documentary that discusses the issue of climate change. The film has commentary from the actor, as well as the United Nations Messenger of Peace on Climate Change, Leonardo DiCaprio. Many people believe that Leonardo DiCaprio was a poor choice for this type of documentary, as he has little to no expertise on this subject. This is true, as even Leonardo Dicaprio admits that he is not suited to educate the viewers about the planet’s climate crisis. However, this film does a great job at making Leonardo DiCaprio someone who is learning about climate change, just like the viewers. On top of this, Leonardo DiCaprio is a very popular and famous person, and using his platform to promote climate change is very helpful as he has a big following. One moment in the film that I found very disappointing was when it was stated that we can not get a climate bill passed through our congress because it is controlled by fossil fuel funded climate change deniers. The people block any bill that would help deal with this problem, which is terrible. Another part of this film that I found interesting was the idea of not letting companies operate in the dark. I am curious to see if making companies publically show their environmental damages will change their actions. I agree with DiCaprio, Obama, and the Pope when they believe that the Paris Climate Agreement was a step in the right direction but is not enough. In addition, after watching this film and learning about the problems with the beef industry, I am strongly considering changing my diet and cutting all beef from my diet. Overall, this film was great at explaining the damages that the human race has done but also informs us to stay optimistic and to just focus on what we can do now to reverse the damages.

Before the Flood does a great job of educating the general public about the ongoing battle with climate change and the means it will take to prevent further damage to our planet and reverse the negative effects it has had on our environment. By introducing the main conflict through the perspective of a well known celebrity, the producers of this film manage to use ethos to appeal to a greater audience and to spread further awareness of this issue. Before watching this film, I must unfortunately admit that I was largely uneducated about the impact that climate change has had and will persistently have on our planet if major steps are not taken. I failed to recognize the catastrophic events that it will lead to, such as heat waves that will make certain places for humans uninhabitable, sea level rises that will lead to the extinction of many animal species, and even worse droughts that will have a severe impact on agriculture. In addition to this, I am overwhelmed by how oblivious and naive money-driven politicians are to the fact that climate change absolutely exists. What is the point of making profits and getting rich off of fossil fuels when you won’t live to spend the money? I believe that we should all wake up and start making green decisions because as mentioned in the film, the politicians will follow once the polls change. We already have the resources needed to make a change, all we need is the political will to save our planet and to preserve the human species.

The film, "before the blood", I really appreciate how Leonardo Dicaprio expresses the severe problem of the climate by using his fame and influence. Prior to this film, the impression of Leo for me is just an actor who was famous for the movie Titanic. To be honest, I had no idea how much of an activist he was. He was just an actor to me, with no ties to the efforts in climate change. But after watching this film, it totally changed my view toward him. The film shows the melting glaciers and degraded forests that are already have severe impaction on ecosystems on earth. It is unpleasant to see how climate and environment have been affected by human beings. I feel like this film used a perfect way to alert the public about the situation we are in. Moreover, it also played an important part to call on people to protect our environment. Also, I believed Leo has also helped this film to become a success. His passion and firm attitude toward environmental protection are so attractive that can motivate viewers to keep watching it and be aware of our environment and climate.

I definitely felt the same way you did after I watched the film! I never knew that Leonardo Dicaprio had such an interest in environmental activism and I have gained a newfound respect for him. This also made me question, that if more famous people would advocate for the protection of the planet, maybe we would have a better chance at saving it. If the influential people in society use their platform to give attention to the alarming problems caused to climate change, more citizens would be willing to help spread awareness, make changes in their lifestyle, and even try to change local laws and regulations.

I am glad we have the same attitude toward this！

The documentary “Before the Flood” really speaks to many audiences because Leonardo Decaprio is in it. I think that it truly helps the world when someone with that big of an influence does a documentary on it instead of someone no one knows. I’m not saying it’s not important if someone else does it, it’s just more likely to become popular and spread further if it’s someone famous. I also think the news reports where they showed many politicians denying climate change. Just like the documentary said, politicians only go for what the population wants, and the population does not see the terrible effects of climate change. It’s sad that politicians will only do something that benefits their votes, not what would benefit the world.
      <br><br>
I never realized the extent of the tar sands and what they’ve done to the world. Miles of these tar sands not only leave ugly land, but they also take away forests and poison the water. Are these tar sands really worth the destruction they have done to our Earth? I don’t believe they are and I feel many feel the same way. Money isn’t worth the damage we’re doing. Unfortunately, these tar sand aren’t the only problem. Almost everything the average person does hurts this world. Even just driving to the grocery store and buying a bag of chips causes a carbon footprint. It’s sad that this is what the world has come to and that people can’t even make the switch from beef to chicken to seriously eliminate some causes of climate change.
     <br><br>
 Before we know it, half of Antarctica will be gone and water levels will rise and places will be washed out because of our selfishness. People with big bucks only deny climate change so they don’t lose their source of income. Americans use the most electricity in the world and we have so many solutions to fix these problems but we ignore them all. If America could change their habits then many other countries would follow. Even just shifting some taxes into the carbon tax would be a drastic help. We don’t have much time left to fix the Earth so hopefully, America can make the change.

I watched "Before the Flood" and I believe that it was an eye opening documentary about the dangers of the climate crisis, both in the future and in the present, and about the politics and policies of different countries regarding it. I had heard people complaining about Leonardo DiCaprio being a sort of hypocrite for wanting change in society in order to combat climate change. However, he does take steps in reducing his own footprint even though people with as much wealth as he does are kind of expected to have a larger footprint as they can consume more items. Regarding his travels around the world, it was paid off with a carbon tax and it's probably not possible to learn so much about climate change without traveling to different places and seeing the effects for yourself and talking to people in charge of policies around the globe. One thing that surprised me was that the climate crisis had a national security aspect to it; as people flee from cities near water, there becomes less land for those people and the people already living in areas that others are fleeing to. I feel like this fact itself would be a big deciding factor for lawmakers against climate change because they wouldn't want their countries to end up in war for resources and internal turmoil. However, maybe they know this but just don't care while sitting on their mountain of cash from the fossil fuel industry. This film helps publicize the climate crisis in a society where "news outlets" are spewing out misinformation and fossil fuel industry paying to spread the lies. However, I feel like the people that need to be educated about this and in turn vote in people that care about it just do not care and are happy sitting around and denying that the climate is causing catastrophes. If anything, if they watch this film, they'll treat it as misinformation and quote their news sources that are spreading the fossil fuel industry agenda. It was shocking to learn that so many aspects in our lives are contributing to the climate crisis and I don't believe that individuals can change this but they need to vote in politicians that will push for reducing emissions and going forward with renewable energy.

The film ‘Before the Flood’ takes the perspective of climate change through the eyes of Leonardo DiCaprio and the many folks he interviewed about the topic. Though I must applaud DiCaprio for using his societal and economic standings to prominently display certain aspects of the issue to a larger population of people, I think that more analysis could’ve been used to address the particular issues discussed. Through multiple interviews around the world, we are exposed to different examples of how climate change has affected our planet and the people on it, however we see little more than sympathetic reactions to these harrowing facts.
     <br><br>

Aside from just presenting the incredibly damaging problems that have been created by humans, we need to come up with plans of direct action. This means more than just reacting with statements of disapproval or disgust - it requires genuine action. Especially through films such as these, there is a huge opportunity to reach more people not just about what the issues are, but how they can be addressed at a personal, local, regional, or global level. We need to limit greenhouse gas emissions and resources need to be adequately distributed, but what currently stands in the way of this occurring? How do we make these idealized versions of our earth a reality, and in the short span of time we have left to do so?

Additionally, if this film truly had educational intent, it would’ve been possible to create this piece on a much lower budget. Using people such as Elon Musk to testify to climate change inherently takes more of a sensationalized approach to the issue - DiCaprio easily could’ve found other folks to testify to the ramifications of climate change on a larger scale but instead chose a person outside of what we could call ‘mainstream’ society. Not only does this reinforce the social media (pseudo) justice that permeates this film, but also appears to keep the power to create change out of the hands of the majority people.

The primary critique of the film "Before the Flood" is that Leonardo DiCaprio is not the right messenger for this issue. However, I believe this view belies the fact the film was not made to simply list out scientific research full of statistics and expert testimony. Instead, it successfully explores the problem, its far-reaching consequences, and current efforts to respond to it. DiCaprio approaches the issue not as a scientist but as a citizen of the world concerned about the future. This is very effective in connecting with the audience because it connects with the audience on an emotional level, relying on dramatic images of the climate crisis around the world instead of complex research that most people would be unmoved by. Additionally, the fact that the film is based extensively on current events that are happening in real-time due to this crisis is effective in showing people that climate change is happening right now and getting worse every day instead of something that is going to happen in the future. 
     <br><br>
A primary part of the film is the discussion of efforts by politicians and activists to combat the climate crisis. DiCaprio explores the current roadblocks to meaningful change, such as disinformation and lobbying by climate deniers and those who have a vested interest in the continued consumption of fossil fuels and other nonrenewable resources. He highlights various examples of how politicians are influenced by climate denialism and how that stunts efforts to mitigate and respond to the climate crisis. However, he also shows examples of how other people are acknowledging and responding to the crisis. For instance, he talked to the mayor of Miami who is building infrastructure to combat rising sea levels that will flood the city. Additionally, he discusses how the only way to change the current political environment is to have overwhelming public pressure that forces politicians to listen to the will of the people. He argues that this type of activism is needed to combat the crisis and just by making this film he is participating in climate activism by leveraging his fame to influence others.

“Before the Flood” is a documentary that was made by National Geographic, which invited Leonardo DiCaprio to make inquiries about some countries and regions that have serious climate problems in order to provoke people’s crisis awareness of climate change in the whole world.
     <br><br>


Many people in modern society are laughing at Leonardo due to the fact that they hold the opinion that he meets trouble halfway. This kind of situation is common in Americans, even the president of America nowadays is making fun of climate change. I am confused about whether he still has not recognized the significance of the problem of climate change or just do not want to admit most climate problems are brought by America and some other developed countries. In this documentary, the pope stands out to call on their believers to focus on climate change; Sweden decided to give up the use of fossil fuel, and more than 100 countries decided to propose the “Treaty of Paris” after intense discussion. At the end of the documentary, Leonardo stood on the stage, encouraging every person to try their best to do some things to prevent climate change happening in the future. It is a perfect ending for this documentary. However, in the real world, the problem of climate change still does not have a practical solution. With the exit of America in the “Treaty of Paris”, to solve the problem become a harder thing than before. 

     <br><br>

The only thing for people to do now is to try our best to prevent this problem from becoming worse than before. I clearly know that the power for one person to protect the world is tiny, however, the power for one person to destroy the world is significant. Also, some developed countries should take responsibility for their behaviors that caused global warming to become more and more serious and should become the leader of the protection instead of passing the busk.

The film, “Before the Flood” takes an approach to get a better understanding of the climate crisis and what we can expect from it in the future. Leonardo DiCaprio takes a curious, yet concerned, lens to observe and learn exactly what the climate crisis is, how it became, what will happen if no action is taken, and what we can do to make a change. So, DiCaprio travels all around the world and talks to a multitude of people to gain more knowledge on the subject, making it to where the viewers are also gaining this same knowledge. This film not only talks about the devastating effects of climate change, but shows them and how it is directly affecting the people and the environment. 
     <br><br>

Because of DiCaprio’s exploring and researching, “Before the Flood” presents the audience with facts about how the economy’s dependence on fossil fuels, food production, and the production of palm oil are the leading causes of the climate crisis. Now, even though we are presented with these facts, there is the issue of people actually believing them. The media, especially news outlets, are even portraying global warming as a hoax, along with plenty of political leaders. Because of this strong representation in the media, the public is prone to also not believe that climate change is real. But, by making films like “Before the Flood”, people are more prone to watch these documentaries and will receive this important information and facts to learn more about the issue. 
     <br><br>

To conclude the documentary, Leonardo DiCaprio presents a way that we could stop global warming. He ends this film very optimistically by stating that political leaders will do what the people want them to do, even if they once did not believe in it before. So, if there are enough people on board to protest this and demonstrate the severity of climate change, politicians will follow. He gives the audience advice by saying that we just need to have political will, consume differently, and vote for political leaders that will fight to end the climate crisis.

Watching “Before the Flood” was an eye-opening experience that I will never forget. The movie not only helped illustrate the massive impact we have on the environment, but effectively called viewers to live a more sustainable lifestyle. 
     <br><br>
A good quality of the movie was its ability to tell the tragedy of climate change through other people. For example, the movie showed climate change effects on different countries, such as India. When in India, several spokespeople emphasized that damage to the climate from the United States hurts their poorer population, crops, and weather patterns. Showing the excess amount of water on top of a farmer's crop, I was shocked to hear that it due to half a year of rain in 5 hours. The film also showed the dangers of climate change on popular cities like Miami, where flooding has been frequent in past years. 
     <br><br>
Another aspect of the movie that really appealed to me was the discussion about American politics and the denial of climate change. Learning that American politics are convoluted with company interests and profits from fossil fuels makes a significant impact on any positive legislation being able to pass. The denial of climate change, I would argue, is something that we need to replace quickly. By replacing congressmen and senators by playing a bigger role within our government is significant. 
     <br><br>
The film in all was an effective way to translate to viewers that this world is not only dying, but it is dying quickly. Leonardo Dicaprio was an excellent main character, as he wasn't an expert but a person who wanted to see a different outcome for this planet. I believe that in order to create a safer world, we all need to take a call to action. This is not only for ourselves, but for all the countries we are destroying from overuse of the planets resources.

I watched the film "Before the Flood" and I think it was done very well, especially in terms of receptibility by its audience. It was a very easy film to watch and I felt that it covered most of the ways that climate change affects us and our environment. What really shocked me was the part where they discovered the hose that used to be 30 feet into the ice only a short time prior, when now the entire length of it lies on the surface. It really made me think about how quick this ice melts and about this article I read last year, where the temperature reached an astonishing 90 degrees in Greenland for multiple days. Events like these will only get progressively worse over time. 

     <br><br>

It was a very conclusive film because it included all the problems that are becoming increasingly evident, the causes of these problems, and potential solutions that we can follow individually and as a whole. I think DiCaprio being apart of presenting this issue and using his platform for good is awesome and something that others with similar influence in films should do also.

After watching the film "Before the Flood" I was shocked and angered that people can be so ignorant as to continuously deny scientific evidence and brush off climate change as a hoax and publicity stunt. The fossil fuel industry is doing everything they can to protect their wealth-- lobbying congressmen to sell credentials to fossil fuel interests. It was frustrating to learn that it is nearly impossible to get a climate bill passed through our Congress because it is controlled by people who are funded by the fossil fuel industry. The same people who are supposed to be the leaders of our nation are discrediting and brushing off scientists who have devoted most of their life studying the issue of climate change just so they can make short term profits. The issue of greed can be seen through the actions of powerful authorities and corporations across the globe. Companies and governments are burning down rainforests to produce cheap palm oil in order to profit while completely disregarding the livelihood of their own people and the forest species. 
     <br><br>


Although it may seem as if nothing can be done since climate change deniers are controlling the Senate, politicians are actually followers of the people--since they need our vote to be in a position of authority. So I believe that in order to take necessary steps, such as passing a carbon tax law, U.S. citizens have to step up first so that politician will be forced to follow.

The documentary Before the Flood uses the meaning of a painting named “The Garden of Earthly Delights” to grab audience’s attention in the beginning and then lead to the major environmental problems that the earth faces today. Throughout the movie, we followed Leonardo DiCaprio’s footsteps traveling to five continents and the Arctic to witness climate change. It showed a great deal of actual, touching scenes caused by global warming, such as the Polar ice caps melting, sea level rising, floods, droughts, and wildfires and so on. Along traveling, the interviews from experts not only well explained what was going on and what were causing the problem but also emphasized the severity of the situation.  
     <br><br>

Although some people think Leonardo DiCaprio may not have been the right choice for this film, I think he was a great fit. DiCaprio represented many people who weren’t informed much about climate crisis, and by presenting how he came from knowing a little about global warming to becoming the United Nations Messenger of Peace, the documentary shortens the distance with the audience and greatly encourages more people to join the environmental protection.

"Before the Flood" gave real life, first hand experiences of the effect climate change is already having and will continue to have. The most discouraging aspect of the documentary was the politicians and climate change deniers. Some news outlets try discrediting anthropogenic climate change because a celebrity like Leonardo DiCaprio is bringing awareness to the issue, pointing out his lack of scientific training. While refusing to believe the 97% of climate scientists that believe it's real. I do believe people are entitled to their own beliefs, but there comes a point when for the sake of our future we must come to agreement.
     <br><br>

This film did a good job of making sure there's still hope. For example, it pointed out how politicians, while touted as our leaders, actually are followers. Pointing out how Barack Obama switched his view on gay marriage, in response to a shift in his followers ideals. This idea that politicians follow the ideas of the public really gave hope that we can actually make an impact and that we can eventually overcome this.  I particularly enjoyed the piece about the cow/beef industry. It too, made me feel like I could actually do something about the issue. Just choosing to eat chicken instead of beef a couple times a week could save a significant amount ofcarbon and methane emissions, which really opened my eyes as I didn't realize the magnitude of the resources required for even just a pound of beef. While I don't see myself going full vegetarian in the near future, I definitely will choose some alternatives to beef.

"Before the Flood" is an amazingly effective film. Di Caprio plays an audience surrogate well without acting like a fool. He knows the climate is an issue and uses his reach to let those who know more speak up and reach larger audiences. He uses his privilege to give voice to scientists and people of color.

     <br><br>

I found Di Caprio's use of the Bosch painting as a framing device extremely strong. He clearly lays out where we are and where we're going with a piece of his childhood that immediately connects him with viewers. Much like Gore, Di Caprio works to not isolate Christian viewers. He sees the climate crisis in the biblical flood. This story can help audiences better understand the severity. (He also, of course, talks to the pope, further cementing that it is not blasphemous to believe in science.)
     <br><br>


One of the truths brought up in the film that made me stop to think was that it is those who contribute the least to the climate crisis that get hurt the most. This is such a cruel karma that pairs really well with the Wallace-Wells article and the idea of the great filter. Society has messed up and others are getting hurt because of it, and thus we ignore the issue because it doesn't fit our common narrative device. This injustice devastates those in places like Kiribati and that deeply saddens me.

     <br><br>

I am very grateful to the filmmakers for not just showing us the effects of the climate crisis, but also what we can do about it. Little things were thrown in throughout the film, like not consuming meat or palm oil, but the ending title cards were something I found even more important. I fully believe the best thing we can do for our world is to vote. To vote for those who not just believe in climate change, but will do something about it. The film quickly laying out what policies to look for was very helpful.

     <br><br>

Overall "Before the Flood" was an impactful and important film. It did a great job of explaining a multitude of things fairly well. I feel it can really help people understand the climate more.

Watching the documentary “Before The Flood” makes me feel like I’m walking with Leonardo Di Caprio through all the stops he made and learning things bit by bit, realizing together with him that how little I actually know about the issue with climate change. I’m really thankful for Leonardo Di Caprio for that he was willing to take use of his fame and recognition as a celebrity to participate and produce such an educational and inspirational documentary. Looking at the clips of the coral ecosystem, the glaciers, and the wild animals themselves made me really start to imagine what the world might be like without them. I think the movie takes a great approach to address the climate change issue by balancing its alarming and encouraging tone. When I was watching, I found that it’s edited in a way that calling on people’s action with a confident and promising voice and a serious attitude that warns and agitates the audience about the scope of the problem were appearing alternately throughout the movie. 
     <br><br>


One thing the movie spends a lot of time discussing about is the numerous campaigns that are confusing and convincing the public that anthropogenic climate change does not exist at all. As the reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” and the youtube lectures have mentioned, our economy largely relies on fossil fuels, including coals, oil, and natural gas. Therefore, many politicians are in alliance with the fossil fuel industry and acting against science to divide the public and aiming to win the debate of climate change denialism. I am particularly fond of one sentence from the documentary, said by the mayor of Miami, which is “The ocean is not republican, and it’s not democratic. All it knows to do is rise.” I think the climate change issue should never be connected with politics, although it still very much is. The only way to— not to say solve— improve our current environmental situation is to be united to deal with the problem, or at least united to believe in the problem.

"Before the Flood" was a good film in that it blurs the boundaries between climate change and politics.  The film strictly held to very specific and undeniable facts that left no room for argument.  Examples included the Canadian Arctic melting, the islands of Abaiang, Kiribati going under water, a huge forest fire in the Indonesian rain forest in 2015, and Chinese citizens put at risk of cancer by just breathing because their air is so polluted.  I thought that it was very wise for the film to be more neutral as I think it makes the film more likely to convert more people into believing and being aware of the climate crisis.  However, the very thing that can convert more people into believing that our world is in danger can also undermine the environmentalist movement as it dismisses the severity of the situation.  

     <br><br>

The film also presented a very interesting idea with its presentation of politics verses science.  There is no longer any doubt about the science behind climate change, and yet many people still do not believe in global warming.  The main reason is because it has become a battle between politics and science in order to gain supporters.  There is a Republican disinformation campaign heavily funded by fossil fuel corporations, and they are effective in convincing people that global warming is a hoax.  I thought this idea was very interesting because now I see where help is needed in the climate crisis with an importance equal to scientific advancements: politics/media.  

     <br><br>

"Before the Flood's" enrichment in ideas, facts, and representative vivid images made it a film that I would think is worth watching for everyone.  The film was entertaining in taking the audience around the world to show the effects of global warming, and it is perfect for  introducing the climate crisis to the public.

The documentary “Before the Flood” was a pretty good movie, but I feel as if it would’ve been better if Leonardo DiCaprio was accompanied with an actual scientist. Yes, he is a be actor and has a huge platform to bring a voice to this issue but at the same time he doesn’t have the credibility of scientist to prove that climate change is negatively impacting the earth, which is very true. I however did enjoy the documentary it honestly hurt my heart to know that earth will basically rot away within the next 10-20 years and it sucks to know that we the people have the opportunity to slow down that rate but no one wants too, when all it takes is one vote or even just cutting down on beef consumption as Dr. Eshel brings up. One thing that hurt my heart was when they showed how the forest were being destroyed and how much the ice in the attic has melted. I feel like this film really brings into the light the huge impact climate change is having on our planet and if we don’t do something about it, then we will all perish.

The film “Before the Flood” did an amazing job displaying the impacts of climate change and what we humans can do to stop these catastrophes from happening. Leonardo Dicaprio was able to visit various locations around the world in order to document significant changes already happening to our planet. The film itself was able to provide evidence of climate change in a way that was interesting for viewers and easy to follow. 
     <br><br>

Although he has received backlash from many people for being an actor, Dicaprio has been able to use his platform to travel to various locations, speak to many people including Barack Obama, the Pope, and Elon Musk in order to lay out the evidence that climate change is real and we need to do something about it. He has been able to provide the public with eye-opening information regarding human activity that is urgent and terrifying. As we go about in our everyday lives, people struggle to see the impact our actions may have on the planet. Whether it be driving your car around or doing something simple like eating food from your favorite restaurant, we all impact the environment we live in. As temperatures increase, we see a number of issues form as a result. 
     <br><br>

A scene that really jumped out to me was when Dicaprio visited the Greenland ice sheet and met with professor Jason Box. In the scene, we learn that the plastic hose that is now visible on the surface of the ice was once 30 feet below. Box mentioned it only took a total of five years for the ice to melt, leaving the hose exposed, and causing water to then go to the ocean. This causes us to look at the long-term effects and trends the Earth is heading towards. Box mentioned that, if the planet were to stay heading towards an increase in temperature, Greenland would then vanish. This would cause significant problems such as rise in sea level. Rise in sea level is an extremely important topic many should be concerned with due to the impact it could have on coastal communities. The film documents cities such as Miami who are already experiencing flooding and damage to areas.
     <br><br>

The film caused me to think of ways in which I can contribute to living a more sustainable lifestyle. Recycling, supporting locally grown produce, buying used clothes, and carpooling can help limit the number of resources needed to produce or transport goods and will help lessen greenhouse emissions.

The documentary “Before the Flood” provides the audience with an oversimplification of the disasters that climate change has brought to our civilization. Humanity should not blame the planet for our own actions which are driven by greediness, power and politics. In the documentary, it was referred to that we can think of the earth as a boat that is sailing across the universe and that little by little it is degrading to the point where it starts sinking. If the earth “sinks” then all of us are going to suffer the catastrophic consequences of our actions.
       <br><br>
       I realized that while humans have the capacity to do the right thing, we lack the political courage to do so. Politics play a large role in the global warming crisis. Many American politicians are full of ignorance that cannot comprehend the impact our society is doing to the planet. Scientific models and the resulting predictions have been presented, and yet they have the audacity to say that climate change is not real. In order to start making a change in our country, many have asked our senators to at least listen to what climate change is doing to people around the world. We are a democracy and the power is within our hands. Take the example of Barack Obama. He opposed gay marriage but when polls changed, he also had to change his denial of gay marriage. Otherwise, people would not have elected him again. The same thing can be applied for climate change. Politicians only care about maintaining a status in government and that can only be achieved if they agree with the majority of the population.
         <br><br>
     Another issue is our greediness. It is a fact that our economy is completely or almost completely based on fossil fuels. The fossil fuel industries do not care whether or not their products are contaminating the earth. They care about the money they make. Scientists whose lives have been dedicated to studying climate change have been made fun of by reporters and politicians across the nation, discrediting their work. If this was not enough, these scientists have also received death threats from “anonymous” subjects. But it is obvious that these “anonymous” individuals are those same politicians and CEOs of the fossil fuel industry that preach hatred and fear, or their uninformed supporters. This hatred and fear spreads throughout the scientific community, making it even harder for them to publicize their findings without being threatened or ridiculed.
         <br><br>
     These two issues that were subtly presented throughout the movie really made me think about the level of immaturity government officials have. Needless to say, our current president believes that climate change is a fairy tale told to bring “chaos.” Leonardo does a great job exposing the different consequences of climate change around the world and how each community has been affected. The two issues aforementioned were more subtle clues that I think Leonardo was trying to convey to the audience, as if he was saying: yes, this is happening across the globe and we need to do something about it, yet we have to start with our own government officials that can then confront those in the fossil fuel industry.
         <br><br>
     Lastly, I believe that the use of the painting the Garden of Earthly Delights is a good tool used by Leonardo to introduce the audience to the earth that once was and now is, showing the progression of our earth since it was handed to us in the beginning of times. The second panel of the painting is indeed where we are at the moment but that will very much change in the next few years. We will find ourselves in the panel where everything looks like an apocalyptic and doomed world. To finalize the film, he goes back to the painting where all started and shows one final image which is only seen when the panels are closed. It shows an earth encapsulated in glass to show the fragility of the planet we live in. It is up to us to strive for a change, to convince our politicians to do something about the possible and disastrous future that our future generations are about to inherit.

Your insight on the film is great. I think the points you made about a lack of political courage and the overall greediness of people being major factors in this issue. I also think that even though humans do have the capacity to do the right thing they often fail to be able to draw the line between charity and duty, they think it is charitable to donate to climate change orgs not their duty. I also think your point about politicians trying to match their platforms to the majority opinion is spot on. There is a really toxic greed for power among politicians so they will almost always say what they believe the people want to hear even if they themselves are not really convicted by such beliefs.

<br><hr>
 As you have stated, politicians only tell us what we want to hear and pretend to do the right thing. The climate change is an important environmental issue that is affecting us  and if we don’t do something about, then it will be our downfall. We have to get together as a community, not only a group of people trying to protest about climate change, but as a united community that wants solutions for this problem. In order for this to change, we have make believe our governmental officials about the dangers of climate change. When they decide to do something, then we can go from there up the pyramid of power and get to those who control the fossil fuel industry.
<br><hr>
Your commentary on the film regarding the politics of the climate change is a good analysis, as I feel that the underlying politics of many global issues are often ignored. I believe that it is because it is not in the interest of the ruling class, or those in power to address the issue, as it would mean compromising their wealth. For example, the economy is heavily based on fossil fuels, as stated throughout the film. The economy relies on coal, oil, and natural gas, and those who invest in such sources of fossil fuels have done whatever they can to make sure that they have access to such commodity. Therefore, it is no surprise to note that such corporations do not care about their consequences so long they have access to such commodities. Activities such as mountain top removal, fracking, drilling, tar sands, are all practices which are not only risky by disastrous to the environment. However, since much revenue is generated from such practices, corporations do not seem to care. 
         <br><br>

Therefore, by looking at the politics behind climate change, we are able to see that humans are in fact able to address climate change, but they do not want to (referring to those who are able to). As Dr. Sunita Narain had mentioned, the United States, one of the most powerful nations in the world, is doing comparatively nothing to address the climate change. The underlying reason, is thus vast amounts of wealth which is controlled by few. Though the film acknowledges that the fossil fuel industry is destroying the planet, it does not address the very nature of the economy which drives and keeps the fossil fuel industry in power. Wealth is what holds power, which is why it is difficult to address climate change; the fossil fuel industry has enough power to work as they please.
         <br><br>

Another important point that helps better understand the politics behind the climate crisis is that poor people are those who are disproportionately affected, and who are the first to be affected by the climate crisis. Dr. Sunita Narain stated that it is not her who will be impacted by the first wave of climate change, but those who are poor. The film helps better understand this when DiCaprio visits the farmers whose crops had flooded due to climate change. 
         <br><br>

Thus, this film is very informational and passionate, though I feel the politics should be addressed better.
<br><hr>
I agree with your points on the film and was also surprised at how little some groups who claim to support the environment do to slow climate change. Another factor that is not too surprising but still sad is how politicized climate change is because of how it affects industries. There are political leaders who deny climate change when the city of Miami is sinking every year just to support the construction of new skyscrapers. That is why it is important for leaders to step up or replace current leaders with ones who put an importance on the environment. Leonardo Dicaprio did a good job in becoming a major face of the environmental movement and other celebrities should follow his example but political leaders need to implement laws to guarantee a reduction in greenhouse gases by all major industries. Current international treaties in place such as the Paris Agreement are a good start but there needs to be more punishments in place to make sure countries follow through with the agreement.
<br><hr>
I agree that the movie oversimplifies the Climate Crisis, and on your point that the earth is system that exists beyond the use we have for it. However, I think what makes this documentary great is that it is made to draw people in too environmentalism. My 57 year old Grandpa, who barely believes climate change is real, doesn't want the same in-depth six hour movie describing all the socio-political intricacies of climate change and the science behind it. He would immediately turn off a documentary that started with "the earth is its own autonomous being and we have disrespected it for too long". But he sat through the whole hour and a half with me, and by the end he had so many questions. We literally talked about this movie and the climate crisis for hours. He started green initiatives at his church and at home, and has started researching local politicians for their thoughts on green issues before voting. I can not stress enough how unusual this is for him. Without a movie such as this one, which eases the viewer into the situation, he would have never listened to me. This movie also applies to people like my mom, who don't think they can do anything about the climate crisis and therefore never engages with it. But she heard it was a Leonardo DiCaprio movie and went out to watch it with her girlfriends. I think the wide scope and effectiveness of the movie excuses any compromise or vagueness it contains, as the net good it does outweighs the simplicity.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with the points that you made regarding this film. It is so important to note that politicians shape our world and the policies that are made up of it. It is their stance that influences us as the voters and the "political courage" is something that we lack as a population. Many Americans are not educated on just how dire the situation of climate change is and the politicians do little to enforce those sentiments. In addition, the fossil fuel companies really do not care whatsoever for what happens to the planet that we live on. This is extremely unfortunate because they will do anything to make their money and discredit the scientists who have the evidence and studies to prove that climate change is an issue that we need to work to stop right now. 
         <br><br>
In addition, Leonardo Dicaprios insights throughout this film are all very correct. I believe that he was the perfect person to play this role in the movie because people are more apt to listen to someone that they have seen before on television and can recognize them and agree with what they are saying. His commentaries about the consequences of global warming and the disinformation campaigns that he discovers are all reasons as to why we need to work to combat the climate change and everyone who states that we have nothing to worry about. Lastly, I thought that the interview with Sellers was very significant because he showed just how much of his life he was devoting to fighting for the cause and spreading awareness as he was fighting his own battle of pancreatic cancer as the movie was being filmed.
<br><hr>
I see now how the film is more to introduce people to the issue of climate change instead of being a very in depth informational piece on the topic. Choices made in the film such as choosing a well liked celebrity to be the main person of the film shows how it is trying to reach audiences that maybe would not usually watch films on topics such as climate change. I found it inspiring how this film was able to be a successful introduction to climate change for your family and hope it could be this way for more of the population. I truly believe that starting discussion about a problem is one of the most important steps to solving it so this film does just that. The film was made both to entertain with beautiful scenic views of nature and to teach with jarring visuals of third world countries negatively affected by climate change. I believe that once any person watches the film, doubter or just someone uneducated about the scenario, will become a believer and hopefully a supporter of green movements.

After watching before the flood, I had a better perspective as to how this crisis is one that is global and not only affecting the poorest of countries. This film was particularly easy to follow and watch as I have enjoyed other works from DiCaprio. From the beginning of the film, DiCaprio connects to the viewers by stating his position as a citizen and not as an expert on the matter. He's not a scientist with formal training but a person who is trying to bring about political and social change to the climate crisis. This helps the viewers feel connected to the issue and is different from other informative documentaries which lecture directly towards the audience using experts or complex statistics. Instead, the documentary outlines DiCaprio's journey and commitment to the crisis and inspires the audience to do the same. 
         <br><br>

One of the points that resonated with me was the fact that people of higher socioeconomic standing throughout richer countries would be the less affected by the climate crisis than those who are in poorer countries but these higher socioeconomic standing individuals would be producing more of a carbon foot print than those who are poor. This is sad to hear because it outlines the selfishness of humanity in respect to how the climate can change the entire world but some overlook it because it does not affect them directly. 
         <br><br>

Overall, this documentary was not only eye opening for me in terms of knowing more about the subtle changes that need to be made but it was also very effective in delivering valuable perspectives from experts and celebrities that made the issue feel more surmountable through real social change and hard work. I felt personally moved by the regions in which DiCaprio visited and decided to focused on because it gave me a better perspective on how this issue is being dealt by other cultures.

"Before the Flood":         <br><br>

         <br><br>
The film "Before the Flood" follows Leonardo DiCaprio around the world as he explores the climate crisis from many different point of views. This is the reason this film is so powerful compared to other ones that I have seen. Before seeing the film, I knew that Leonardo DiCaprio was a prominent environmentalist so I was confident in his ability to portray the issue. Although the film covered ideas that I have already learned about, the visuals made it easier to understand and learn. One visual that stood out was near the end of the film where the effects of climate change were shown to DiCaprio on a large screen. This allowed me to visualize the ice melting and how some regions would actually become colder rather than warmer. 
         <br><br>
Another part of the film that was impactful was when it showed the point of view of the Indian women from Delhi. This viewpoint was different than what you usually see. She was upset with Americans for trying to preach a sustainable lifestyle in developing countries, even though the US prospered off of fossil fuels. This goes to show that the climate crisis is not only an issue of green house gas levels, but also an issue of severe social and cultural ideas. Who gets to decide how countries and individuals power their lives?

“Before the flood” is a documentary movie mainly focuses on the global climate change problem from Al Gore's point of view. Al Gore never stop putting his effort to make our world a better place, and he has been working with climate crisis problem with those professional people. Al Gore’s arguments were so persuasive, because his arguments were not come from his imagination, everything he said was the actually things he saw and experienced with clear data. For example: the melting ice in the Arctics caused serious trouble in the Florida.The climate problems never stop bothering us, because most of us never care about it. Al Gore is not a scientist in the climate area, therefore, the data he covered in this film is not difficult to comprehend for common people like us.
         <br><br>
We have to accept the truth that the ice in the Arctics will melt in the next ten years. This will intrigue series of troubles for our civilizations. There is already a huge disaster in Australia, the big fire causes hundred millions of wild animals’ death. And the big fire is still going on, the color of the sky turns yellow, the temperature of the Australia goes up drastically. This is not the worst part, the prime minister of Australia is spending his holiday somewhere else. So we can’t see people are taking this problem seriously.

When I first started “Before the Flood”, I was skeptical of Leonardo DiCaprio being the focus of the film. I believed that he may have been using his star power to bolster the popularity of the film, rather than a passion for the issue of climate change. However, I couldn’t have been more wrong, the film emphasizes how DiCaprio has been part of the environmental fight against “Global warming” for many years and also shows that he takes this issue very seriously. Additionally, the documentary actually addresses this, showing news clips of the skepticism surrounding his appointment as a climate ambassador for the United Nations.
         <br><br>

I feel that an effective point that the film makes in the argument for Climate Change is how the world is suffering as a result of greed by corporations and those in power. This was best demonstrated through the resistance that politicians and those advocating for eco-friendly policies and those who intend to combat climate change are faced with. It demonstrates the opposition that they are faced by those who vehemently deny climate change because it hurts their oil industries. Additionally, politicians are often quick to dismiss such policies because they have connections with large corporations in natural resource industries. 
         <br><br>

Another prominent issue that this documentary address is how food corporations are hesitant to introduce substitutes for palm oil and other components that are present in many of our different products. Because it is a key component of many consumer products, there is a huge demand. This massive demand leads to many environmental consequences. However, there is no push to find more eco-friendly components because of the cost of such an undertaking.
         <br><br>

While the film does address other issues of Climate Change, I felt that this common theme of the prioritization of money over the environment was especially powerful because it showed the consequences of our capitalistic society. The audience is forced to face the opposition that those in support of the environment are faced with, as well as gain a better understanding of the corruption and questionable business dealings that are occurring in present-day America.
         <br><br>

Overall, I felt that the film was very effective in demonstrating the multiple consequences of the Climate Crisis. By having us follow DiCaprio, it allows the audience to view the world through his eyes. In this documentary, he isn’t just an actor or celebrity, he also provides a new perspective on climate change. When he travels the globe, he gives the audience a greater understanding of the global impact of this crisis. The audience isn’t just shown the consequences of society’s actions, they get an in-depth look at how it is affecting the people of Earth as a whole.

Before the Flood: My first reaction to Leonardo Dicaprio being the narrator and surrogate of the film was not positive. In the beginning, I laughed and asked myself why they would make him the main person of the film when he is just an actor, but as the film progressed I realized why this was the best choice they made. Not only was Dicaprio able to bring a bigger audience because of the movies he’s been in, but as a viewer, I was also able to relate to him and felt as if I was there with him. Although Dicaprio was not as educated, through the film his motivation to learn and make a change, made me as a viewer want to do the same. Overall I believe it was a great approach because it made the movie more engaging. Throughout the film not once did I feel bored. 
         <br><br>
The part of the movie that shocked me was when they began to talk about the people who do not believe in climate change. I used to always ask myself why there was never any laws passed to help this issue of climate change, but now as I saw in the documentary on how many of the politician's other source of income was oil companies, therefore explaining why they refused to believe in climate change. And their denial of climate change then leads to them not wanting to pass laws about it. Although the documentary talked about the way laws have not been passed for climate change, they did state that we the people could also help in passing those laws and that is why we need to be present within our government by voting and etc. This upcoming election is the first year I will be able to vote, and I will make sure that I keep in mind climate change when voting and being an active voice in the election. While watching the documentary I was able to see all the beautiful places on earth that are being destroyed which really opened my eyes.

Additionally, if this film truly had educational intent, it would’ve been possible to create this piece on a much lower budget. Using people such as Elon Musk to testify to climate change inherently takes more of a sensationalized approach to the issue - DiCaprio easily could’ve found other folks to testify to the ramifications of climate change on a larger scale but instead chose a person outside of what we could call ‘mainstream’ society. Not only does this reinforce the social media (pseudo) justice that permeates this film, but also appears to keep the power to create change out of the hands of the majority people.

I believe that the way many climate films are made, including Before the Flood, are extremely successful.  Using DiCaprio as a “surrogate” for the audience, as Ken said, is a very effective rhetorical device because it makes the audience feel as though they are going along with him on this journey to learn the hard truth about climate change.
         <br><br>


DiCaprio does not necessarily try and hide the fact that he is well informed about climate change, rather he takes his viewers on this journey by having the film take place in many different parts of the world where you can see climate change happening in real time.  It shows that even the most informed people are still shocked by what is happening, it is hard to avoid when you are looking at the consequences straight in the face.  I admire the filmmakers and DiCaprio himself for taking this approach as it does not seem like an easy task.  DiCaprio acknowledges that although you can read as much as you want to learn about something, there is nothing like going out and seeing it for yourself, it makes a huge difference.  This film is effective because of the fact that it is not just someone sitting in a chair talking with maybe a few snippets here and there of the effects of climate change, it is actually the complete opposite.  It is so overwhelming and shocking most of the time that it feels good when there is a small break in intensity, which is what they want.  They know people need to be shocked into making change and that is exactly what they do in Before the Flood.

After viewing “Before the Flood”, I think that the use of Leonardo DeCaprio was a cry to appeal to a specific audience who may not tune in to informational studies on a normal basis and attract a new demographic of people who look up to him as a famous role model. I believe that if all hollywood stars were to become involved in this way, information would reach a larger portion of society and resonate with younger generations who are in reality the ones who need to know the information and act on it the most as it is our future at hands. I think that the criticism he has faced for taking a role in the climate crisis really shows the ignorance of people and how society today will try to pick a fight over anything instead of seeing the bigger picture.
         <br><br>

A major point that Leonardo made that stood out to me was the denial of climate change that comes from government officials and politicians. I think that the structure of our society places a high authority on these people who we are supposed to look up to and trust to make the best decisions for the population. If we cannot have faith in our expected leaders who have the power to reach to a vast majority of society and influence them to protect and serve to our best needs, then we are forced to rely on a broken united front of individuals of the population who all have different perspectives and can typically not come to a consensus. 
         <br><br>

Overall, I think that the points made in the documentary were very strong and it made me understand through a different and more relatable lense some of the critical dangers at hand such as how much of the land in todays world is used for fracking and its effect on greenhouse gas emissions.

When I watched Before the Flood, I really enjoyed it for the way it approached the climate crisis. This is specifically in terms of how Leonardo DiCaprio acted like a surrogate for the audience to get to the climate crisis and talk to experts about it. I liked the formula of following him around and learning about his background more closely, and how he became an activist. My favorite element of the film is in the opening, when he discusses a mural that was a part of his childhood. It was interesting learning the significance of the mural in his childhood, as well as how this transcended into adulthood and his fight against climate change. 
         <br><br>

With that said, I can't help but think about the other purposes of deciding to put Leonardo DiCaprio himself in the film. In the beginning of Before the Flood, he contextualizes his place in environmentalism and how he started working for the UN. In this discussions, he specifies the backlash he received from people that rolled their eyes that a lofty celebrity like himself has gotten involved in a very serious and intangible problem at times. Towards the end of the film, I myself couldn't help but feel the same way - Was DiCaprio doing this to promote his own work and establish his role in the hierarchy of climate change? It seemed a little bit like a publicity stunt at times, particularly in the fact that his carbon footprint throughout the film was ironically large. I don't think it was necessary that he was in the film, and that his role in activism could have been more profound if he had directed the film, or solely produced it. 
         <br><br>

As a result, one of my favorite moments of the film was when he goes to India and discusses climate change with Sunita Narain. She blatantly calls him and the US out for the fossil fuel industry and their refusal to move to solar power, and points to statistics that show India's work against climate change and the precautions that they have taken, despite their poverty. This is even more significant given the fact that people like Leonardo DiCaprio, at his socioeconomic status, will not get harshly effected from climate change, unlike those at a lower socioeconomic status. I wanted to leave this film feeling positive, but given the vast differences Leo and I have in this status, the problem of climate change just seemed even more intangible and overwhelming for me to grasp and be able to attack myself. WITH THAT SAID, I think the film did do a good job at giving the audience an opportunity to hear from experts like Elon Musk and NASA experts on what they think about climate change.

Before the flood:         <br><br>

Within the first 10 minutes of the film Dicaprio says “I stand before you, not as an expert but as a concerned citizen.” and I think the majority of the population can relate. He’s able to use his credibility as a public figure to speak out against what we’ve been ignoring for a while. I found it interesting to see how Dicaprio approached these different political figures and how they responded to what’s happening around us. You notice that some of the people he talks to are more willing than others. This film spreads awareness and highlights the factors that contribute to our social crisis. Along with the special features, the images of the world around us in war, the comparison between how climate change affects the wealthy versus the poor, they both illustrate how our planet is in conflict with itself.  When Dicaprio visited India, he talked to environmentalists about how behind we are in ending climate change. People like Paul Ryan and the Boch brothers are why we’re lacking in environmental sufficiency. They're continuing the notion that "climate change isn't real" when this film clearly shows there is. It’s going to be too late if we continue at this rate. 
         <br><br>

I thought using Leonardo Dicaprio as a spokesperson for this film was smart to have a more engaged audience. He’s someone well known that’s able to draw attention to certain issues. As you watch the film you also find yourself impressed with how passionate and serious Dicaprio is about this subject. He’s prepared and strives for solutions.

I agree with you in terms of your opinion about how DiCaprio was a smart person to narrate the film. I think that because he is using his platform for bringing awareness to this issue, he gains a lot of respect from the audience to take some sort of action. At first I thought why is an actor speaking out about the environment, but as the film continued, you could definitely see how he is more involved in the issue than many other celebrities. With the recent fires in Australia, Leo even donated millions of dollars for support. I think it shows how caring he is about the environment, and that he is both a celebrity and a major environmentalist too.

“Before the Flood” was an eye-opening documentary that delivered necessary information in an easy-to-follow and engaging storyline. I believe that Leo’s role as someone who is interested in the topic but not necessarily an expert actually made the documentary easier for viewers to connect to. It’s less that it’s Leo DiCaprio and more that it’s someone who genuinely loves earth’s biodiversity (the narwhals scene was touching). I love that the documentary encompassed a lot of various locations around the world, from Miami to Indonesia; it lent a “global scale” to the crisis. The whole concept of the painting being this foresight for the impacts of climate change is absolutely brilliant, it serves as a guide throughout, and acts as a call to action. The level of interviewees for the documentary is astounding (the Pope, Obama, NASA project director) and lends credibility to the message of the documentary. Something about the interview with the NASA scientist hit home for me. His cancer is such a human ailment, yet it felt insignificant in the face of a dying earth. That interview specifically lent so much perspective, it’s not you or me, it’s all of us.
         <br><br>

The fossil fuels industry owns key percentages of our legislative bodies, and everybody knows, yet change has still not come. Money and public opinion are the only things now that can make a difference in Congress. Like the documentary made mention of, politicians’ minds change when it’ll get them re-elected or polling higher (think Obama and gay marriage). If a grassroots campaign can educate people in districts where our corrupt politicians live as to the climate crisis, we have a real shot at changing politicians’ stances towards climate-friendly solutions. The other aspect that always follows decisions is money. If we can buy out the politicians by paying them more than the big oil and natural gas lobbyists, they’ll follow us. It’s my belief that most of the corrupt politicians actually do believe in climate change; they’re greedy, not stupid. (Ok, Ted Cruz is both). If we can get public support and money towards green causes, we have a shot at passing legislature like the Green New Deal, a long shot from the beginning, but drastic measures are becoming increasingly more and more necessary.

Out of all of the films we have watched, I strongly believe that “Before the Flood,” a film on climate change presented by National Geographic and Leonardo DiCaprio is the most effective at delivering valuable and concerning information to get viewers to want to take action. It is refreshing to finally see one of the most prominent actors in todays world take a stance on a problem that some people still won’t believe. Because so many people idolize and respect what DiCaprio does, we can only hope that many others will follow. I thought it was amazing how he travels all over the world to shed light on some of the problems we can’t see. For example, when he was in the North Pole he had been informed that if we don’t do anything about climate change, in 2040 it would be without ice. As concerning as this sounds, it is hard to enact climate change laws- something DiCaprio discovered visiting government offices. The majority of politicians are corrupt in the sense they do not want to believe or they are blind to the immediate and long-term effects of climate change. Overall, I think this film was extremely well rounded and did a successful job of using facts, data, interviews, and first-hand accounts to foster growth of climate change awareness in our world today.

This film was very eye-opening to me and provided me with a lot more scientific, visual, and informational insight about the climate crisis. I am disappointed that I did not watch this film earlier, and I am surprised that this film did not garner as much attention as it deserves considering that is is very well-made and insightful. It made me realize that when it comes to climate change, a lot of people simply just don’t care, no matter what kind of devastating or daunting facts are provided to them. They think that it is not that serious, and somehow the world will figure out a solution, the world will fix the problem on its own, or it will never get that serious. I know that I can’t expect every person on this Earth to be active climate change activists, but I find it absurd how some people choose to do harmful things to the environment just because alternatives pose a minor inconvenience. For example, the use of one-time plastics is so trivial looking at the whole climate crisis, but everything adds up, and one piece of disposable plastic is still a meaningless pollutant on Earth. I also like this film because it explains how the actions, no matter how little or how big, of humans lead to larger consequences in the long run.

Regarding a specific moment in the film, I found the part when they showed the stick/hose that was under the ice a few years ago was now on the surface due to ice melting. The melting of ice causes a plethora of problems directly for arctic life, and indirectly for the rest of the world. The lack of ice equals the lack of habitat for arctic animals. Additionally, it messes up the ecosystem of prey and predators, perhaps leading to an influx of a certain species or a efflux of a certain species.

While watching "Before the Flood" I feel as if I brought the same biases many skeptics and even politicians may have when listening to someone like Leonardo DiCaprio as it begs questions of "why you?". But as I continued to watch it those ideas slowly crept out of my mind as it was no longer who I was hearing it from, but the message I was receiving. If we're to solve an issue we have to be ready with open ears and active hands. The message the documentary carries is powerful and scary but it does a good job at painting reality and presenting the audience with facts and an in-depth look at the global effects. I feel that an audience gets more out of first-hand experiences of events, detailed by first. hand account of them rather than second-hand accounts from various news outlets. You scroll past a post or tweet about the wildfires in Australia because it is hard to look at and is extremely tragic but at a swipe of a finger it is out of sight and mind, but being bombarded with information through different media platforms like documentaries forces you to listen and take heed.  Fear is an excellent motivator but falls short with a lack of hope, which is one place where environmental awareness documentaries like this lose a lot of their momentum. But I do believe that is where the public picks it up, I feel more inspired than ever to carry this everywhere I go and the better we are able to spread this message the more effective it will be.

“Before the Flood” is a film that vastly explores climate change denial through the exhibition of facts contrasted with the views of skeptics. 
         <br><br>



Leonardo DiCaprio leads the course of the film and serves as a narrator through which the viewer may absorb the content presented to them. DiCaprio is, notably, not a scientist, and this may cause many critics to view his stance on climate change as unimportant. From the perspective of many, he is merely an actor who has no business involving himself is large, worldly issues. however, I believe his stance is valid. Climate change will affect everyone, its effects will not discriminate between scientists and actors or conservatives and liberals. This point is communicated throughout the film as people of varying stances are interviewed while the effects of global warming are detailed. 

         <br><br>


It is truly shocking to witness how many educated people believe that climate change is a hoax. Some choose to claim that the facts provided by scientists are incorrect and that the calls for action from famous people such as DiCaprio are invalid. This is shocking because the film provides extensive research to back up the claim that climate change is very real and very dangerous. I appreciate DiCaprio’s willingness to step outside his career and bring attention to an issue that he is passionate about. No one has to dedicate their career to climate change in order to get involved, and if we all get involved, perhaps the issue could be stopped.

When watching the film, "Before the Flood", I went in unknowing of how we could counter the threat of climate change quickly and effectively without crippling our economy and ultimately hurting those in the middle and lower class. An interesting solution proposed by Harvard economics Professor Gregory Mankiw was the idea of a Carbon tax. In summary, what this does is that it places a tax on any activities that pertain to emitting CO2 into the atmosphere such as buying gas for your car. Initially, I was slightly skeptical, not of the fact that it wouldn't be effective in reducing CO2 emissions, but in the fact that it would hurt lower income families who were already struggling to survive from paycheck to paycheck and are now having their taxes raised even higher. Many of these low income families rely on automotive transport and often don't have access to public transportation and so now being taxed on their gasoline, everyday life becomes much harder, just to support a cause that unfortunately many of these people couldn't care less about since it seems so trivial to them. 
         <br><br>

This skepticism I had was soon alleviated when Professor Mankiw went on to elaborate that by establishing a carbon tax, you could cut other taxes in response so that the net total taxes that each person has to pay remains generally the same. This in turn means that lower income people aren't having to sacrifice more of their money/quality of life, and for those that aren't incentivized to switch to public transportation, that money that they pay for the carbon tax can than be repurposed to supporting the continuing fight against climate change, thus a win win situation.

Prior to watching “Before the Flood,” I truly did not realize how rapidly this issue is impacting so many different aspects of human life.  I was aware of the severity of the issue, but I was unaware of how quickly the world is changing day by day.  Along with this, I appreciated the way in which the film documented how these issues are impacting people from all over the world with different societal backgrounds.  It truly put into perspective the social, political, and economic challenges that are being faced by people everyday from the rapidly changing environment.  In particular, when the film touched upon the political aspects of climate change, I truly realized how this issue goes beyond just the environment.  It was interesting to see how politics and the world economy plays a huge role in this issue and what different people are doing to solve it.  On another note, I felt that using DiCaprio as the main figure of this documentary was a smart idea of the producers as it humanized the issue a little bit more and showed a side of DiCaprio that is not always seen.  However, I believe the criticism he got from being the “Messenger of Peace” of the United Nations was incredibly unfair as this position’s sole purpose is to be a public figure from any professional background willing enough to relay a message to the people.  Many commented how DiCaprio has zero scientific training which deems him as unqualified for the position.  However, this is entirely unfair to say as the position does not require any scientific background or intense research to relay messages to the public.  
         <br><br>


Although I was saddened after watching the film, I feel more educated on this topic and motivated to continue to research what I can do to help slow the impacts on the environment.  Despite the fact that the film made it seem like we are far from coming to a solution, it was comforting to see that there are still passionate individuals that work tirelessly to better the environment.  Now that I have a greater understanding about how this topic impacts different aspects of human life, I feel I can make more conscious decisions in my personal life that will contribute to the ease of the climate crisis.

I was astonished by the film “Before the Flood”, which focus primarily on climate changes and all kinds of human beings have faced, are facing, and will face in respect to climate crisis. When I saw Leonard as the primary speaker and viewer in this film, I was concerned about was he convinced enough to act as a protagonist in the environmental activist film. And the rest of this film has successfully told me that Leo was the right choice. Following his steps, the audience got access to the polar areas, Miami, and got interview with Republican mayors, and even presidents. Throughout the film I was pretty anxious about a lot of voices that treated environmental activism as a political weapon. Human beings need to take our own responsibilities to at least recover some of the mistakes we did to our beloved planet to benefit the earth and ourselves. Why politicians make everything political related? I really want everyone to take a look at the scenario at polar areas. Tons of ice have already run into the ocean in liquid state. If the sea level keep rising, we will soon lose Miami, Long Beach and all kinds of beautiful places nearby the coast. But some of us still cannot realize that saving the earth has already been an emergency for decades. We really need to take actions from now on, from everyone on.

"Before the Flood" did an excellent job of breaking down the climate crisis into clear, understandable language that exemplified the severity of the situation. I agree with Xinmeng that I was initially concerned on how Leonardo DiCaprio would act as the protagonist of this film; However, I felt that this gave the film a more personal feel because many people are already familiar with DiCaprio on screen. Although DiCaprio does point out that he has a lot of knowledge on the matter, he explains that there is always more to learn. I liked this approach because I felt like the guide of the movie knew what he was talking about but wasn't claiming to know everything. 
         <br><br>

Throughout the film, DiCaprio guides us around the world- from Miami to Greenland. Each location brings up a new issue and introduces the viewer to a new environmental expert. For example, in Greenland, DiCaprio observes the melting ice sheets and learns more about how fossil fuels have caused the snow to melt and darken the snow. He also meets with influential figures like Barack Obama, Elon Musk, and Dr. Piers Sellers. By introducing us to Elon Musk- an expert on power sources and engineering-, and also Dr. Piers Sellers- a former astronaut, DiCaprio paints a very holistic perspective on the matter. I can say that after watching this film, I am definitely more terrified on fate of Earth in the coming years.

I personally liked the approach the film "Before the Flood" took, I felt as if I was right there with DiCaprio. This film really let me visualize a lot of the things I have read about and it was devastating. Much of the film was very appalling. It was even crazy to see how they could not film in Canada because their set melted and had to go to a very far distance to film with snow.
         <br><br>

This film pulled a lot of my heart strings. I was especially moved by the part about the Leuser Ecosystem in Indonesia. It was nice to see the elephants at first, but learning about what is being done to their home really breaks my heart. I cannot believe that even buying a bag of Doritos could give the palm oil industry a reason to continue burning down the forest. And that is not the only ecosystem being harmed. In the film we were also able to see the negative impacts on coral reefs. It is such a huge sorrow to see all these things and to also know that places that consume very little are being impacted the most.

The film ‘Before the Flood’ which features Leonardo DiCaprio, takes an interesting approach on the search for the main causes of climate change, where its being felt the most, and what can be done to mitigate the problem. Leonardo DiCaprio meets with various politicians to discuss and debate the relevance of climate change. DiCaprio goes to countries such as India, the South Pacific Islands, Indonesia, and many more, to see first hand the effects that many industries create by fracking, deforestation, and factory production. After watching the film, I realized how much America emits CO2 emissions and how little we are participating in trying to reduce those emissions. Because of that, many third world countries suffer from the harsh outcomes. I was most shocked to see how climate change has impacted the South Pacific Islands. In only 12 years, many parts of the islands became uninhabitable despite the islands being the least to contribute to the cause. Larger countries (mainly America) criticize and blame smaller countries for relying on fossil fuels or electricity to power their communities, but they contribute less than twice the amount to the source of the climate crisis compared to these larger countries. ‘Before the Flood’ allowed me to realize the position that I was in, how much I contribute to the greatest crisis in the world, and what actions I can take towards saving a planet that we are quickly destroying.

The film, Before the Flood, was a breath of fresh air, informative, and extremely entertaining for me to watch since Leonardo Dicaprio was the narrator. I learned about how much damage human-induced climate change and global warming has had on the planet’s sea levels and the efforts of contrarians to hide the truth from being known. According to an expert in the film, “in 2040, you will be able to sail across the North Pole . . . there’s going to be no sea ice left in the Arctic Ocean in the summer.” The animals that live in the North Pole will no longer have a habitat and eventually they will become extinct. Ice glaciers of Greenland are already melting and the sea levels are rising constantly overtime.  
         <br><br>


If we want to preserve the North Pole and the populations of species that live there, changes need to be made now. States like Florida have had to raise taxes to pay for new infrastructure to counter the rise of sea levels, however the Senator, governor, and cabinet members of Florida have made it difficult for Democratic mayors to make changes. Scientists and researchers such as a Penn St. Professor who discovered evidence of climate change have to deal with threats and being vilified by the media, which can discourage others from publishing their findings. Fossil fuel industry companies are paying these credible personalities on CNN and FOX to discredit these findings by scientists so that they can continue to make profitable gains. These fossil fuel companies are a formidable opponent, but they can be defeated everyone unites together and make changes to save our planet and stop global warming from continuing to occur. Senator James Inhofe is one of the biggest contrarians of human-induced climate change being paid by fossil fuel companies and he is part of the Environmental Committee. This is a major issue because changes cannot be made if there are many more corrupt politicians like him in the Senate. Climate change is also affecting countries such as China and India. The population of India use cow feces to cook with, and once they switch to coal based energy, the globe will get even warmer, which will melt more ice and cause sea levels to rise higher. Ecosystems restablize the earth’s temperature and carbon emissions, and if those ecosystems are destroyed. Beef is responsible to 10-12% of methane emissions in the U.S., and the 
switching to chicken would be better for the environment.          <br><br>




In my opinion, this was a great watch and I would reccommend this movie to family and friends because it helped me realize the dangers of human-induced climate change. After watching the movie, I have an optimisitic view of the future because more powerful people such as Elon Musk are trying to find ways to counter climate change. Like he said in the film, if 100 “gigafactories” are created, the whole planet can be powered with renewable energy. Tesla cannot do this on their own, so other big companies will have to participate in creating this large factories. Also, ideas such as the carbon tax are being pushed for which could help stop global warming. In addition, the formation of an “Earth League” has emerged which is an organization that will try to stop global warming from getting worse. Furthermore, countries like Sweden have completely switched to renewable energy, so the future is bright, we as humans just need to follow through with the plan.

I think this film does a phenomenal job of communicating the problem and the urgency regarding climate change and presenting it in a way that a general audience can both understand and be interested by. It's very effective in its employment of ethos: first, by featuring well known and loved Leonardo DiCaprio, and then by interviewing and featuring many well known leaders and influencers such as Pope Francis, Barack Obama, and Elon Musk. I greatly admire DiCaprio for his effort, and I think he's a great example of using your platform to accomplish positive change.
         <br><br>

I thought his UN speech was particularly impactful. The part where he mentions "the shame that each of us will carry when our children and grandchildren look back and realize that we had the means of stopping this devastation but simply lacked the political will to do so," stood out to me, as this is something that already seems to be happening; the student-environment movement, with Fridays for Future and Greta Thunberg, already shows this occurring, and yet there still is a lack of political will.
         <br><br>

The film did a good job of showing both numerous causes and effects of climate change in different locations, as well as the many different forms that climate change can show up as: from the air pollution in Beijing, to the clear cutting in the boreal, to the incineration of rainforests, to the fragile arctic ecosystems, to the sea level effects that happen right in our own country. While it could have used more people that have really been affected by or are experts on climate change, I think those that did take part in interviews greatly helped establish the ethos that's necessary in reaching the common population. This film was both very captivating and informational, and while it could leave one feeling a little pessimistic, it also is great in showing the desire for reform that many do have, which is so necessary for cleaning up our act.

In the film, “Before the Flood”, Leonardo Dicaprio takes on an insight of the underlying causes of climate change. I find it extremely frustrating how much of the problems are caused due to an endless result of ignorance, specifically from America. The use of fossil fuels can be accredited with making the world’s economy what it is today, however, the money that companies like Shell and ExxonMobil thrive on is built upon the destruction of our planet, such as the Indonesian Rainforest. These companies refuse to see how their business strategies are destroying our planet and on top of that aim to portray climate change as a myth. These big businesses cause many of those in America’s political situation to convey this false attitude towards climate change in order to please the businesses and their own pockets. Many politicians (notably many Republicans) have disregarded the scientists works in order to keep these companies happy as they earn a heavy cash flow from them such as Paul Ryan. This ignorance and selfish ideals are preventing change from happening. The world looks to America as a leader, yet if our leaders continue to lead us in the wrong path away from the climate change issue, then the whole world suffers. America cannot be a symbol for renewable energy when many in office do not believe in it. For example, India would look to America and criticize the lack of our contributions and the increase of our consumptions. WE must do our part as Americans to show the world that yes, renewable/clean energy is possibly; yes, with the work of everyone collectively we can try to create a better future for our world; yes, a change in our diets/consumption can have a great impact in our carbon footprint. If world leaders like America and China can accomplish this, the rest of the countries will follow and hopefully lead to more progressive movements in saving the planet. If not, we will see more catastrophic events like the ice caps melting which will eventually lead to a positive feedback loop of warming. I hope that this does not become the case and our leaders can stop prioritizing the money and realize that climate change is real, it is here, and we must do everything we can as a whole to fix the problem we created.

Climate change is a real issue, yet many do not know what to do about it and have pessimistic views towards it like Leonardo DiCaprio initially did in this film, "Before the Flood". I feel like having a pessimistic view on climate change is natural, especially when not presented with solutions to the problems. When Leonardo confesses he felt pessimistic towards climate change it made me realize we need to spread the message about climate change and its solutions because simply learning about it and changing our own lifestyles won’t be enough if we want to save the planet. I specifically enjoy the ending of the film where it provides easy solutions for ordinary individuals like me to consume differently, vote for leaders who will fight climate change, etc. to make a real difference. Changing light bulbs, for example, just won’t be enough anymore like DiCaprio stated. After watching the film, I got a newfound respect for Leonardo DiCaprio. I was aware he spoke publicly about climate change, but did not know to what extent - UN Messenger of Peace. It is admirable how he devoted two years of his life traveling to different countries noting the effects of climate change on farmers, rainforests, etc. and speaking publicly about it to officials of different countries in hopes of convincing them to make real changes in their countries. He did something a lot of people only dream about doing, despite the backlash the media was handing him because he did not study the environment/climate change in a traditional setting. Seeing DiCaprio using his resources and money to help fight and illuminate the climate crisis makes me optimistic about the issue. If he has the will and motivation to make the world a better place by reducing our carbon footprint, consuming less, etc. than so can I.

I am very clear that the issue of climate involves a lot of things, involving every country, every human being on earth, as well as complex political and interest issues. It is very important because it is a serious problem, which is closely related to all people, but also makes it a difficult problem. Developed countries have entered the post industrial era from the industrial era, while developing countries are now entering the industrial era from the agricultural era. The former is appealing for environmental protection, while the latter is inevitably destroying the environment for development, which is the first contradiction. Most of the current environmental problems are caused by developed countries in their industrial era. As poor developing countries, their production behavior More or less will inevitably affect the environment, and the former did the same in the past. If the developed party does not provide anything, it is unfair and contradictory to encourage or require the poor party to join the environmental protection team.
         <br><br>

If I don't watch this film, it may be difficult for me to understand that raising cattle will greatly aggravate the climate warming. I never thought that the improvement of our economic level and the increase of consumption will affect the environment, on the one hand, it is easy to cause waste, and the waste generated will inevitably need the treatment of nature, on the other hand, our large consumption will speed up the production of manufacturers Production speed, increase its production, and all the things we use, no one product is not from nature. To a certain extent, the more production, the worse the damage to the environment.

Before watching “Before the Flood,” I did realize that climate change is affecting our daily life, but I still failed to realize how closed connected it is to our life. The first time I got to know about over consumerism was from last Black Friday. One of my favorite clothing brand made an announcement that they would not have any items on sale because they do not encourage over consumerism. They said that this might not even influence anyone but they still want to do it. I was not impressed at first honestly, and I thought they were just making excuses for their maximum profit. However, after watching the movie, I realize that I was wrong: over consumerism is having bad influence on us. Over consumerism lead to over production and over consumption, which is no good to our environment. Sooner or later, it will gradually harming us.

After watching the film “An Inconvenient Sequel”, I notice that the government is an impediment for figuring out the climate crisis. Al Gore’s speech is persuasive to me due to its factual examples in real life. He shows the flooding in Florida is the consequence of the melting glaciers. Before he starts the representation, his own experience well expresses the sever situation in Florida. Even he wears the galoshes, his trousers still get wet, representing that the climate crisis is real and affecting our lives right now. In addition, Pope Francis said, “The grave effects of all attacks on the environment are suffered by the poorest”. This statement reminds me the film I saw in Eng22,” The true cost”. The developed countries outsource their products to poor countries due to the cheap labor, making them suffered from the manufacturing pollution and diseases with unfair payment. Those people have to survive in the worse scenarios, while the climate crisis makes them even harder. Besides, Al Gore illustrates the government crisis that has to be solved first. At beginning of the film, we can understand that the government is preventing the environment movement. The government wants to deny the truth that have already happened. Therefore, solving the climate crisis is becoming a much complex task since we also need to persuade the escaper to admit the reality.

Personally, I really enjoy the documentary Before the Flood as it does such a good job by serving as a supplement to what I learn in the class and read in the articles. Leonardo Dicaprio approaches the climate change problem with a serious and genuine attitude, learning the issue together with us viewers. The seriousness of this problem is presented with easily understood explanations, and with visuals and interviews, I get to actually see the consequences and have emotional responses while getting to know the truth. What I like about this documentary is that it not only shows problems from various perspectives, not just by scientists, but also by interest groups and politicians. It addresses misconceptions and asks questions I want to ask - why this problem is so huge, and however, it doesn't get people's attention.
         <br><br>

More importantly, it looks at the positive side and calls to actions -- specifically, how each individual can make small changes and contributions to save the planet together. I used to feel climate change is like the "elephant in the room" - all the terrible things are happening, but few people take the topic seriously - either we feel the "talking" is useless or that our other priorities make us think climate change is not important enough to give much attention. I think Gregory Mankiw made a good point regarding this in the film. He said "I think trying to appeal to people's social responsibility is very hard because people have complicated lives and they have lots of things to worry about, they don't want to have to think about climate change every time they do every decision. They can't." This is why we need to have collective actions such as carbon tax or other effective nationwide and worldwide environmental policies. To reach this goal, as Dicaprio says, the sense of emergency and environmentalism needs to be put into our consciousness. Follow that, we need and we must speak about this issue louder and louder.
         <br><br>

I'll definitely recommend this to my friend.

Before The Flood:
          <br><br>
 In the movie “ Before the Flood” Leonardo Decaprio takes the viewer on a journey throughout the world to find out the truth about The Climate Crisis.  The delivery of this film was effective as Leonardo’s role as an uninformed individual allows the audience members to learn alongside Decaprio about the devastating effects of climate change and what the people of the world can do to reverse it.  I was especially moved by the scenes in India of the dirt poor farmers in India having their crops wiped out leaving them without means to make money for their families.  This illustrates the point that underprivileged are the ones hit the hardest by climate change.  With the scenes in India, the movie brought up a point that I previously had never thought about before.   30% of Indians don’t have access to electricity, not to mention solar energy or other eco-friendly options.  A citizen of India was explaining to Decaprio and the audience whether it is eco-friendly or not, coal is cheap.  It made me think about what is the right thing to do in that situation.  Do you continue to use coal in large quantities and contribute to the climate crisis problem or do not use coal and let many homes in India go without electricity?  This film overall does a great job making the audience understand the catastrophic effects of climate change and what needs to be done to make out home a stable planet again.

The aspect of the film "Before the Flood" that drew my attention the most was the section on the effect of rising sea levels in Florida and the way in which climate change skeptics do not help the cause. The film explained how Florida is very much in danger of being wiped away by rising sea levels. They even showed how the rising waters come up to the streets through the sewage drains, which only makes the state dirtier. It alarmed me the most that their own senator, Marko Rubio, does not believe in climate change was not working to create a bill or a law against some of the things that cause sea levels to rise. As a leader and representative for his stake, Rubio should have done better; the people in Florida have no one to turn to but their representative to ask him to make a change. 
          <br><br>

The film explains why Rubio, and others, refuse to do anything about climate change. Marko Rubio, and others such as James Inhoff, deny climate change because they are making their millions from the burning of fossil fuels. If they continue to deny climate change, they can continue to burn these fossil fuels without feeling guilty about it, and thus continuing to roll around in their dirty money. This is why we cannot get a climate bill passed - because the Senate is run by these greedy people who make money off of the burning of fossil fuels and who care more about making money than they do about the environment. 
          <br><br>

Hopefully soon the people of Florida will be able to re-elect a representative who care about their state washing away, and someone who actually cares about the citizens in the state in which he is representing.

The film, “Before the Flood” mentions how the glaciers are melting and how does it leads to negative consequences. Leonardo DiCaprio leads us to follow the truths of climate changes and understand the dangers that are occurring on Earth due to climate change. It has already impacted the main interconnected ecosystems on earth. If we continue to ignore the truth of climate changes, we are actually destroying the earth that is the only place we can live on. After watching this film, I began to realize the importance of global warming to the human being and have a sense of urgency in fighting with it.

Last night, I watched the latest documentary film "before the flood", which was very shocking! Due to the realistic visit of global climate change, we have a better understanding of the great harm caused by human activities to our planet.
          <br><br>
It took Leonardo two years to go to all parts of the world, including the Pacific island countries with a large land area submerged, India whose cultivated land was destroyed by a rainstorm within one day, Alaska, and Sweden the first country to only rely on new energy, and China, which suffered from haze. The first-hand information and interviews presented to the audience constantly prove the authenticity of global climate change. What impresses me most is his interview with the director of NASA's climate division, who has found out the terminal stage of cancer. He wants to spend his final time to contribute to our home. NASA's real-time satellite monitoring of the feedback data on the map of the world is changing the impact of climate change. According to the calculation, if no remedial measures are taken, extreme weather phenomena such as hurricanes, tsunamis, droughts, extreme heat, extreme cold and other disasters will be more frequent. The director's positive and optimistic attitude is very cheerful. Ordinary people, including myself, also see so many evidence that we are hurting the planet badly. The first reaction is not only shock but also frustration. But he said that as long as more people get correct and scientifically based information and wake up the awareness of protection, we can still save!

In the movie "Before the Flood" really opened my eyes as to what climate change is doing to our world, not only to our country but countries and lands all across the planet. In the movie, Leonardo DiCaprio was verbally attacked about his claims on climate change by people who didn't believe it was happening or people who just didn't believe that climate change was a real thing happening to the world. It was interesting following along with the movie and seeing how DiCaprio uncovered the truths and the horrible reality of how climate change is affecting us.

          <br><br>

 It is hard to believe that after having a great amount of evidence of what climate change is doing, people are still naive enough to not believe that it is real and to keep exploiting certain acts that add on to the negative impacts. The main issue is that the government is not doing enough to bring this to attention and to stop all the negative productions people are contributing to this crisis. One of the biggest most negative practices people and companies still perform is fracking. If companies and corporations would slow down this production or more over stop completely, there would not be so many negative effects going on. The extracting of fossil fuels and the pollution put into our air causes so many problems, but the biggest obstacle would be having people actually stop this and have a change of heart to want to save our planet.

I had previously watched "Before the Flood" in English 22, so I watched "An Inconvenient Sequel" this time. I personally did not know much about Gore until watching this film; I knew he was a climate activist, but not how influential and dedicated he was. As said, Gore knows his stuff about climate change and shows this in his films. Dicaprio takes a different angle through his film, "Before the Flood", in his film he takes us on a journey around the world to learn about climate change along with him. I really enjoyed Dicaprio's film more than Gore's because I felt I was learning alongside him, and not just being taught. I liked being able to see different places around the world and how they were being affected. For instance, in "An Inconvenient Sequel" when they showed the huge ice sheets and how they were actually melting, I was able to understand climate change better. I have been really lost on how our ocean levels will be affected, and how the glaciers are actually melting. I am from the California central valley, where we are below sea level, would the area I live in once again be filled with water when sea levels rise? Being able to see how Florida is already flooding, showed me that climate change was our new reality and that we need to do something. Seeing how other people are affected by the climate crisis, and how I may be personally affected is extremely motivating in changing my non eco friendly habits. I felt that rhetorical devices used by both Gore and DiCaprio were effective, but Dicaprio's film spoke out to me more than Gore's.

Before the flood effectively to convey the severity of climate change. Before the flood is my favorite film that this course provides. Maybe because this movie illustrates by the Leonardo DiCaprio, I was deeply attracted when I first saw it. Everyone knows that he is an excellent actor but do not know his contribution to the environment. This movie claims that Leonardo DiCaprio was also a simple person who do not pay much attention and care of the environment issues especially climate change in the beginning. However, when he realized these are serious problems, he took actions immediately. He visited Antarctic, China, Indonesia and other many places to deeply learn about the environmental problems, and try his best to appear the public to attach importance on it. He deeply to understand the fossil fuel, ocean, forests and other ecosystem’s influences on climate change He also went to the United Nations and gave a speech to express his real anecdotes of protecting environment. By contrast, some politicians unexpectedly to deny the severity of climate change because that is opposite to their interest. After watching this film, I felt a little pessimistic. Because many of human have not realized their particular actions have led a terrible cause to destroy their planet and destroy the environment they live on. Students like us who are in higher education should clearly understand that protecting the environment is the common goal of the public. I recommend this film to every casual audience. Even Though we are not as good as Leonardo DiCaprio has the power, the prestige and wealth that support he to do some grand things can protect the environment, we can do the little things around the us, like Save water and electricity, use public transportation, eat less beef. A little bit of small resources to protect the environment, the accumulation of the environment, and finally will become a feat

“Before the Flood” by Leonardo Dicaprio is really impressive and does a fantastic job to draw viewers’ attention to the problem of climate change. He uses a significant number of firsthand records. He displays how coastal cities like Florida are suffering from sea level rises with scenes of water coming out from sewerage and streets submerged by sea water. He demonstrates that tremendous amount of ice has melted in Greenland over the past few years, which really makes me terrified. The contradiction of how countries like China are actively fighting against global warming versus how the US are still immersed in the illusion that humans are not the main cause of climate change is very powerful. What a shame it is when others are working collectively to reverse the global warming with exploration of renewable energy, while you stick with fossil fuels. Especially, when this contribution is accompanied with the fact that hundreds of millions of people in India do not even have access to electricity. The poor is suffering much more from the global warming than the wealth. This really encourages viewers to think about what is really important to do under such circumstance. Personally, I underwent an emotional transition throughout the film. During the first half of the film, I was indignant about American’s nonfeasance toward the climate change. And since one of the most powerful country is not setting an example, I am very pessimistic about the future of all human beings. However, there is a transition to the last part of the film, where Leonardo interviews President Obama and one of the top scientist in climate change. Both of them are optimistic about the future because they believe in mankind. Moreover, there simple things that every common man can do to fight climate change. Simply replacing beef by chicken can reduce around 80 percent of our carbon emission in terms of food consumption, which is already a significant amount. This really makes me optimistic since that is something we can do regardless of our political leaders and policies. Together, we can reverse the global warming, as long as we have the will to do so.

The film " An Inconvenient Sequel" is a very great film regarding to the problems caused by climate change and people's efforts and improvement of this problem. I become a big fan of Al Gore after this film. I think he is really great in not only making this great documentary, but also in improving the climate problems. 
           <br><br>
 He also introduced the problem with local examples, such as melt of ice with the pictures of fallen iceberg; The great amount of CO2 release with the polluted picture of Beijing; People died because of heat in Syria... He said he missed a chance a few years ago( the satellite), so he will not let the great timing flipped,  it was really great. However, I can also see the problem of being a politician--there are always some things that you can not change through your own will or methods. However, I am still excited when he helped reach out for India, and the happiness he had when his effort was working and the renewable energy is becoming more and more widely used. And I would never forgot about in the end of the film, his speech at the square. " It is right to save the future for humanity! it is wrong to pollute the earth and destroy the climate balance! It is right to give hope for the future generations!" It is not easy, but let us follow his steps.

By watching the film "Before the Flood"，I was shocked by how people doubt the actions and thoughts of leonardo Dicaprio by claiming him as an actor from the hollywood instead of professional scientist learning climate change.
           <br><br>
In the same way, people refused to accept the attentions brought by Greta Thunberg by saying her to be a little girl who knew little about climate and the earth. However, people did those simply because they are not willing to accept
           <br><br>
the trueth that they did harm to the climate and earth and they should take response by redusing pollutions.
           <br><br>
The film also pointed out the united states spended a great deal of dollars every year to convince the citizens that they are not inflencing the climate at all. All disinformation actions and absence of EPA under Trump's command enabled 
           <br><br>
the united states to avoid to pay repair the harms done to the climate and earth to make insurance to its total economy. I really hope more people with standards and influence could stand out to bring more attentions to the importance 
of reducing pollutions like leonardo Dicaprio and Greta Thunberg.

The movie, "Before the Flood" directed by Fisher Stevens takes a one-on-one approach to the climate crisis. Leonardo Di Caprio, being the protagonist, takes us with him on a journey that lasts two years where he exposes some of the biggest impacts of climate change in the world. Throughout the movie we start to get more familiar with the main cause of the climate crisis, such as the release of greenhouse gases— methane and carbon dioxide being the most harmful ones. We now see in areas like Beijing, Canada’s forests, Indonesia, India, America, Greenland and the Arctic regions the repercussions that high temperatures and human activity have had on those communities. It impacted me to hear that some of the fires are intentionally started by big companies that heavily rely on burning fossil fuels so they can use the land to construct palm oil plantations.
           <br><br>

It is estimated that within this century, many of the communities living near the coast, such as Miami, are going to be underwater due to the increase of sea levels.The problem is already happening. Miami has seen in the last decade floods that intervene with human activity, and even then the congress has not agreed to pass any bill regarding this issue. Our political system needs to act now but they seem to not believe in climate change, thus they do not realize that it also affects our agriculture, migration, our economies, etc.

Just as the professor states in his lecture, the film Before the Flood provided a unique approach to introduce climate change, to tour and learn with Decaprio. Filmmaker first introduced the background that Decaprio was appointed the ambassador of climate change, a field that he barely knows. Therefore, the situation echoes with film viewers who also want to know more about climate change. Then, the film follows on to introduce Depario’s several interviews with experts in different nations, including US, India, Sweden and China. The director tended to provide a alerting sense gradually, making people face the problem directly especially for poor nations, how can they invest in clean energy if thousands still lack electricity source. After that, the film followed Depario to an interview with Mask about solar panel batteries. After being informed that building 100 factories like Tesla’s could address all energy consumption of the world, Dicaprio was informed that it is indeed possible for developed countries to help work out the problem. Therefore, the emphasis switches to communication between different governments and political issues. Therefore, the filmmaker then posed Dicaprio’s interview with the president of the free world, Obama, and asked him about his view about climate change. The filmmaker deliberately adopts the interview here to express an optimistic mood, in contrast with the alerting tone in the middle, which could be used to encourage the viewers to act instead of crying without acting. The strategies used by directors of Before the Flood serve to be successful from my perspectives as it creates a feeling that you have a companion, Dicaprio, who learns everything with you.

The film basically talks about the sea rising due to the greenhouse effect. As the global temperature goes up, large amount of glaciers melt, and sea level raises. This climate change will largely affect human and animal activities. For example, polar bears live in North Polar will hardly survive and hunt for food on the continually melting ices. Also, cities near the sea which have large population will possibly be submerged by the water in the future. Flood has drowned some small islands already, which caused huge impacts to people who live on the islands. 
           <br><br>
The reality is very serious, but some politicians don’t believe climate change is the largest problem in the world because they don’t feel the increasing temperature. In fact, they tend to believe the Earth is able to recover by itself. However, a lot of organisms such as forests, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, had been largely destroyed by human activities. These organisms help the Earth to absorb greenhouse gases and lower the temperature, but they also decreases in amounts because of human beings. The Earth can’t recovered by itself. 
           <br><br>
The continuing pollution affects on climate change, as well as people’s health. In some developing countries like China and India, pollutions caused by factories are influential. Children are infected diseases because of bad air quality. Especially in India, some people don’t have electricity in their daily life, so they have to use the primitive ways to cook, illuminate. They also produce a lot of greenhouse gases back to the air. This is a vicious circle. If we only change some small actions to protect the environment, it is largely not enough to the whole system. Governments and companies should consider to solve problems from the beginning point, regarding the production of greenhouse gases, human beings and other living organisms can be protected from the environmental crisis such as a flood.

<p>
Before the Flood, a documentary shows the environment of different countries and different regions to highlight the severity of global warming. In the video, I was deeply impressed by the continuous flow of glaciers. If people don’t figure how to stop this, there is no doubt that in the future, all the glaciers will disappear. In Miami, a project can only last for 50 years. Repeating 50 and 50 years is not a good way. It is impossible to raise the whole city up like a mountain. A new method must be found to eliminate the disadvantages of sea-level rise.
           <br><br>


After watching the documentary, I can’t believe that there are still so many people who don’t believe in global warming. These people with such a higher education are so ignorant. What’s the difference between them and pigs? Also, I haven’t realized that livestock can impose negative influence on the environment.
           <br><br>


There are still a large number of people in the world that cannot access energy. Honestly, as an international student, I would like to see that the US can help developing countries as the video says, but in my opinion, no offensive, that is impossible, or in better words, very difficult. Just like the video says, “The small island nations who contribute the least to the process of climate change, are actually going to feel the worst impacts.” It is good enough that Americans can change their living habits to reduce carbon emissions.

           <br><br>

In the end, it is good to see that most of the countries in the world that would like to bind together to face the problem. And as a member of humans, we should respond to the call of the government and contribute to environmental protection.

“An Inconvenient Sequel” stands out from other climate change films in that it focuses on the political aspect of the crisis rather than the causes. This different perspective allows the audience to witness Al Gore’s and others’ efforts in combating climate change within the political realm. Al Gore effectively and credibly demonstrates the attempts and lack of through his political background, connections, and publicity. A shocking example is the flooding streets of Miami caused by the sea level rise due to climate change. Although the effects of climate change are overtly affecting Florida’s residents, the senator does not believe in and refuses to discuss climate change. Unfortunately, this is a perfect example of why no drastic measures have been made by the government to fight climate change; as Al Gore points out, democracy needs to be fixed first because the big contributors are actually the ones in control. I was not very surprised by this notion, but I was a bit taken aback by the reveal of how companies like Exxon are sabotaging renewable energy solar panels by portraying them as expensive insufficient investments. However, renewable energy sources are in fact part of the solution in combating climate change. These examples demonstrate the influence of politics in the fight against climate change and accentuate the importance of events such as the Paris Agreement which entails that countries aim to keep the increase of temperature below 2 degrees Celsius. The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreements is a disappointment because, although there is no enforcement, the agreement was a step in the right direction in combating climate change. Now the United States, a leading nation, is in a way telling its residents that climate change is not an issue. Luckily, there are politicians that believe climate change is a pressing issue. Al Gore provides hope by alternately showcasing that a very conservative town such as Georgetown is by itself aiming to be 100% renewable.

This film, “An Inconvenient Sequel”, was by far one of my favorite films I’ve watched. I was in Eng 22 and all of those films were very good, but this film was just very well made and it showed all aspects of the climate crisis. It really showed the ups and the downs, the conflicts and solutions, and just revealed everything in this crazy, chaotic, and insane crisis. Al Gore seemed like such a genuine and great person and really showed a caring for the world that only a few people have. He did a very good job at making this film it brought out almost every emotion I have. I was very sad, happy, angry, relieved, etc throughout this film. I’m glad that countries and people around the world are enacting change to save the planet such with the climate conference, yet was angered that we had such a big setback with the election of Trump. I think that his election really set the world back a lot of years with the crisis, as everything was looking up, and then he decided to redo all the good done within a few years. The thing with the climate crisis that upsets me the most is the fact the humans have no remorse for the animals that we are screwing over. Just as stated with the mosquitoes moving, many other animals will have to migrate to survive, otherwise they will die. Anyway, I thought this film was really good and I’m going to recommend it to my family and maybe even a couple of friends

I agree, I think this film did a great job communicating how complicated it is to fight against climate change and how many difficulties we are going to face a long the way.  I especially appreciated the emphasis on leadership and the humanity angle the film took on -- they really underscored the fact that the climate crisis is a social threat and solving it will requires revolutionary social acts. At the end of the movie Al Gore is speaking to a group of activists comparing the environmental movement to the abolition movement, women's suffrage, and civil rights. He said there are always points in revolution in which it seems like you have lost, but that doesn't determine how the fight will end. I feel like this was a critical point to make, especially after watching him face so many defeats on differing scales. 
           <br><br>

I thought it was interesting how Al Gore called himself a "recovering politician," when really, through the work he is doing, he is still participating greatly in politics. For example, his communications with Indian representatives in regard to the Paris agreement had a huge impact on the outcome of the convention. I think because of these skills -- skills that even if he claims he can no longer use, he still carries with him -- he was a good person to guide the film. We don't just want to a watch a film on all the ways humans are failing, we want to watch someone fighting for what is good and gaining momentum to change the tides.

After I watched the documentary “Before the Flood”, the scenes of the climate change indicated multiple climate disasters. Leonardo DiCaprio stands up as the ambassador to alarm and awake people about the climate change is a great tactic to spread his influence on the public and to educate people about climate change. Although DiCaprio is not an expert of climate change, the influence of his public figure is a great method to bring attention about this topic. Fossil fuel, as a main source for the operation of a society has been causing severe consequences to the environment. 
           <br><br>
Governments are fighting for such scare resources by deforestation and exploitation; “there is no such thing of clean fossil fuel”. People are exchanging healthy ecology with wealth that eventually killing the environment. The melting ice in Arctic is the great concern of global warning, the rise of sea level will case the flood that invade cities we live in. “Water is coming up from the drains” that ruining operation of a city, the ignorance of climate change will need people to pay back. In the film, Florida government was banning the word “climate change” because the greater focus is financial gain.

Before watching the movie, I have already had a general idea about this sequel of An Inconvenient Truth, which I saw it several years ago. My first idea about protecting environment was from An Inconvenient Truth, so I really felt glad to see the sequel of it. 
           <br><br>

Unlike what I was thinking before, the movie was not only talking about how people damaged the earth with showing bunches of data, instead of this, he showed how hard he tried to save the planet. The Paris Agreement gave the effective step for protecting the environment, but the leaving of US definitely gave a big impact to America and its people. When everybody is trying to save the planet, America just takes one step back, that is frightening to me. Some of the scenes are horrible and many of them are sad. 
           <br><br>

The data and information in the movies are fairly new to the people, which brings more emotional and cruel truth to the audience. Since we have seen the change together, we can understand this movie much easier. Everything is relatable; Every meeting, every phone call, every decision, everyone is involved in it. This may be the mission we can't escape as human beings on earth. We need or even have to face the truth that we should protect the earth.

The documentary “Before the Flood” surprised me by how impactful it was. I myself believe in anthropogenic climate change, but I have trouble with feeling like my small actions will never be enough to slow the effects of our past exploitations.  I know many facts, but none of them stuck in my mind the way the harsh images did after finishing the film. I loved the interviews; seeing democrats, republicans, and people from all backgrounds around the globe inspired me.  When Leonardo DiCaprio interviewed the woman from India, I was astounded.  The way she called out the United States for their rate of consumption and carbon footprint - the urgency and desperation in her voice - is exactly what the world needs to hear.  Our carelessness is not just a topic of discussion or a conjecture on the future, but is actively destroying villages, forests, coral reefs, and is not going to stop unless we take action to do something about it.  China, though they are huge emitters, are at least keeping track of their companies, even to merely monitor what waste they are actually producing.  Meanwhile, the US is the second largest emitter, and we barely fund cities like Miami, which is already feeling the projected results of rising sea levels. But still, I liked how the film still allowed for some hope. For instance, when DiCaprio interviewed Elon Musk, the idea that once a snowball effect of transferring to using renewable energy picks up, it will affect all parts of the world.  What pains me is that this film was released in 2016, four years ago.  And yet, despite the time that has passed, not much has changed. If anything, conditions have gotten worse, making the situation more dire than before.

<p>
After watching the documentary “Before the Flood”, my view and attitude toward climate crisis and global warming changed compared with the feeling after reading Wallace-Wells’ “The Unhabitable Earth”. “The Unhabitable Earth” gives me a wakeup call and lets me learn and know the catastrophic consequences and effects of the climate crisis, also rising panic to readers. However, the documentary provides a new point of view and perspective to think about global warming and climate change. It is not the time to fear the climate crisis and future, but we should take immediate action to solve the problem and the issues themselves are not unsolvable. 
           <br><br>

DiCaprio visited a lot of countries and places to experience what climate change has brought to us. The broader field of view toward the world and contact with authorities creates credible arguments and evidence to convince the audience about the truth and existence of the climate crisis and persuade people to make immediate changes to reverse the situation. Some scenes where DiCaprio went and saw are shocking and unbelievable. The most impressive one is in Bablomekang, Palau. The President of this small republic, H.E. Tommy E. Remengesau Jr., said “the small island nations contribute the least to the cause of climate change actually going to feel the worst impacts, the worst scenarios because of global warming”, which let me stop and think, as well as reflect. It is true and undeniable that people, like me, experience and enjoy the convenience that technology and industries bring, but people who in poverty may suffer dramatically from the climate crisis. It is a shame. Moreover, many scientists and authorities are optimistic about climate change and they claimed that the issues can be settled unless people and countries are in agreement to make efforts to repair our planet immediately. This actually raises hope for me, and what every individual can do is controlling what to do next in our daily life and shifting our high-consumed lifestyles to reduce the release of carbon dioxide. The issue is urgent and the time to do so is NOW!

<p>
After watching the documentary Before the Flood, I gained more awareness on the urgency and severe consequences of climate change and global warming. Human beings in this day and age are unwittingly changing the climate. With Leonard Dicaprio being the protagonist, the film portrays some quintessential crisis that challenge the livelihood of well beings such as overconsumption of greenhouse gas, severe flooding, tropical forestation. Among them, I was most shocked by the idea of sea level rising. According to the movie, there will be no ice in Arctic oceans in the summer of 2040, which is presumably twenty years from now on. I couldn’t have imagine how pity it is for our future generations to miss the great image of glaciers and natural wonder. The increase in sea level also inevitably brings concerns to living habitats. Polar bears will no longer stay in the Arctic circles and the fishery around this area also gets suffered. Despite the Arctic cycle, rise in sea level in other low-land regions such as Florida will also be disastrous for the local citizens. The straightforward solution is to migrate to other safe places whereas this strengthens the competition for limited resources and provoke violence.

           <br><br>

The second plot that caught my attention is the balance between energy preservation and usage, mainly regarding Indian areas. It’s reported to be the third largest emitter of greenhouse gas due to its highly dense population. Because of its great gap in property, a small amount of people couldn’t have basic access to energy and there is scarcity in resource allocation. This makes me cherish more of my available living condition. I’m thankful for all the electricity, water, and living environment that I’m currently experiencing. Additionally, I was exposed to knowledge regarding Paris Agreement which I seldom paid attention to before. Every coin has two sides. It targets at restricting the global temperature without strong enforcement provision. It’s already a great success to see diverse countries collaborate together as the identical human race. Just as how Leonardo conclude the movie, “we are the last best hope of Earth.”



</p><hr>

<p>
The exposition of Before the Flood interests me because we join DiCaprio as he reflects on his childhood and the curious eyes with which he looked at the painting. We're taken around the real world that the painting depicts and I find myself in profound bedazzlement as we see the effects of anthropogenic climate change. The painting is being approximately modeled by the world around us. I am consistently taken aback by how nonchalantly these beautiful, but also very necessary proponents of our ecosystem are so readily destroyed and consumed for this momentary monetary gain. I can't help but wonder what more they need pay for? Surely the loss of profit by reducing destructive harvesting of these resources would be competitive with the amount of money poured into lobbying for dis-action. Truly shocking.

           <br><br>

And no doubt worse, the arrogance and neglect for the human life and suffering that occurs from the externalities further introduced by the extraction and combustion of fossil fuels. Personally, I feel that this is nothing short of despicable. The journalist go to a village and we see DiCaprio making a pathetic gesture of kindness that pales in comparison to the injustices committed by our industries. Of course, the blame is not to be directed at DiCaprio. Additionally, the anger of the Indian government official was clearly difficult to contain as she mentions how the U.S. doesn't take responsibility, doesn't stay to their word, and expects the others to offset the negatives we have caused.
           <br><br>


The film does a good job of introducing a young and blind audience to a variety of the consequences that our pollution has caused, gives us some idea of where the pollution comes from and why it persists. It may be brief in its treatment with the impossibly numerous ways it affects our planet, but it is enough time for the audience to get an idea of and be disturbed by the ruin of something they care about. Be it the beautiful coral reefs that have paled and died, the homes and lives that are being destroyed in front of their eyes, the intentional burning of the Indonesian forest for palm oil, the gorgeous glaciers that shrink, whatever it may be, you'd almost have to be a sociopath not to be compelled to investigate the topic when the film claims that we're responsible for this harsh adversity.

I watched both films and An Inconvenient Sequel and Before the Flood were both very effective since they conveyed all the information and issues of the climate change during a trip or working experiences, which was like Al Gore’s and Leonardo DiCaprio’s fighting processes and journey recordings. I felt very engaged with DiCaprio when he interviewed the local people and scientists to acknowledge the current situations, which created a connection with the audiences and we seemed to learn the problems together. In addition, the introduction of the really big moulin in An Inconvenient Sequel vividly showed me the actual and so bad effects of global warming in Greenland. Moreover, celebrity like Leonardo DiCaprio and Al Gore were useful in capturing people’s attention and they were able to meet and interview many authorities and politicians who played significant roles in the climate change issues like President Barack Obama and Elon Musk. The join of all theses celebrities made the documentary more interesting and believable. 
           <br><br>

I believe the audiences of this film are casual viewers, since it was easy to understand by listing the comparative statistics and I believe the images of the frozen ice and the destroyed forests are the best evidences to make audiences believe the severity of the problems. Also, Al Gore, as a celebrity, can successfully drew more people’s attention to care about these issues using his influences. For instance, he not only went to the Greenland to check the original cause and scene of these melted water, but he was also at Florida to let us see what the melted water had caused because of global warming.
           <br><br>

The theme of this documentary was obvious and it aimed to alarm people that the harmful impacts of climate change, like the overuse of the fossil fuels and the emission of the CO2 in the atmosphere, were influencing the whole world. So, DiCaprio traveled to many places, like the North Pole, Greenland, China, Amazon Forest and so on. I found the rapidness of the ice freezing caused by the emissions of the CO2 and Global warming in both of these two documentaries shocked me the most, since the monitoring equipment which was buried deeply under the ice came out to the surface because of the melted ice turned into water. 1 degree seemed unimportant in our daily life, however, this 1 degree has caused dramatic and serious issues around the world. A peninsula maybe disappear just because of this unnoticeable 1 degree. Also, the interview that was so emotional and moved me a lot was Jaitley’s claim about the sufferings in developing countries. That’s the most ironic part of the climate change, since a large portion of the Indians even didn’t have electricity and power, but the poorer they were, the worse situations they were facing. 
           <br><br>

I will definitely recommend these documentaries to my friends, since both of these two vividly described all the real situations and let people see the actual bad impacts and real imagines instead of just hearing about what was going on.

Before watching the film An Inconvenient Sequel I knew global warming was affecting our world, but I didn’t know to what extent it was happening. I did not realize that a multitude of people have been experiencing the effects from it already, for example, the floods in Florida and the Philippines. Watching the video clips of people trying to survive the floods was extremely heartbreaking, because you can see how frightening it really was for the people experiencing it. The movie showed some of the dire effects global warming can cause, which made me realize that we need to start taking action now before it becomes forever irreversible. I was glad to hear that he was training people on climate crisis, even if it started off small, because we need more people to educate others about what is really happening in our world. Not only was Al Gore creating change in the United States, he reached out to other countries to create change there as well. I like that the movie brought up how politicians and people need to talk and to listen to scientists more when they are warned about global warming and the effects it has. The movie focused a lot on Al Gore’s story and his credibility, but I wish it would have focused more on what we can do to help stop the effects.



</p><hr>

<p>
To be honest, my attitude towards the climate crisis has always been pessimistic. I have always believed that humans already made the machine of global warming rolling, it's simply too hard to make it stop. One man’s power is just so limited to do anything about it. But after watching An Inconvenient Sequel, my beliefs are shaking.
           <br><br>

Having a figure like Al Gore working for climate change is exactly what the world needs. Seeing that Gore advocating his climate training program is inspiring, he created hundreds, even thousands of active environmentalists in the past decade. The collective impact this program makes is unimaginable.
           <br><br>

The section of the film that Gore was visiting the icebergs of Greenland was also a very effective visual representation of the issues of global warming. Seeing the torrent pour under the iceberg, the poles of the stations showing more and more after time, the iceberg is actually melting away, there’s no denying it, and it's melting fast. Also, seeing Gore negotiating with India was breathtaking. The way he made a couple phone calls, contacted Elon and other giants in the field of sustainable energy and just solved the energy problem for a country with 1.25 billion population was astonishing. It was crucial to get India online with the cause of alleviating global warming.
           <br><br>

My takeaway of this film is that we might still have a chance at saving our climate, it just takes time, resources, and faith.

I found the film "Before the Flood" to be both captivating and informative in communicating the message of a need to combat climate change on a global scale. I believe that documentaries such as "Before the Flood" work effectively to bring attention to issues that need to be addressed more often. It is easy for people to sit back and watch a documentary that highlights the most essential parts of an issue rather than hearing loads of confusing data from scientists. I think that it was important to include a prominent figure such as Leonardo DiCaprio as an advocate for a global problem that people seem to continuously brush off. Although people criticize his interest or knowledge on the topic of climate change, Leonardo is the prime example of someone who is attempting to inform themselves and use their platform to make a change in the world. Leonardo was efficient in making the information about climate change easily understandable so that it can reach a wider audience. I believe it was especially important how he highlighted how he, as an American, was contributing to leaving such a large carbon footprint. This encourages people to take accountability for their impacts on the planet, and pushes them to reduce such impacts.

The film “Before the Flood” main goal was to spread the alarming issues of climate change doing it in a way of educating the audience and introducing evidence. The documentary did an excellent job of covering the main points and effects of climate change. As well as, introducing first-hand accounts of those already dealing with the implications. For example, the farmers in India are losing their crops and food due to the effects of the changes in the climate. It is truly depressing that those that are facing the effects of climate change are those that have contributed the least to the problem. Leonardo DiCaprio allowed the audience to see the whole experience through his perspective as just another person in this world trying to help. The idea that the evidence and message was in a film simplified it, allowing almost everyone to understand that we need to take action to prevent further damage. The Paris Agreement in the documentary was a good first step but it is still not enough. It was a historical event that so many countries are finally taking charge. But with no reinforcement to back up the proposal, it would be up to people to make sure that their country is following along. As mentioned in the film the Paris Agreement is still not enough, we must all take great actions to see results. All in all, the film “Before the Flood” highlighted the pressing issue of climate change that we must all open our eyes and find a way to help.

I really agree with the way you saw the movie and how it was made basically as an alarm to wake people up from whatever dream-like state they were in. I also thought the documentary was really well made and proved its point excellently. 
            <br><br>
While watching “Before the Flood”, I was really astonished to find out that Leonardo Dicaprio was so heavily involved in the fight against climate change. It really opened up my eyes to the idea that this really is a fight for everyone even movie actors such as Mr.Dicaprio. I think the documentary was really well made and it definitely showed Dicaprio’s ability and his own acknowledgments. He was humble and even straight out denied being a scientist hurting his own believability but then proceeded to back himself up with subtle mentions of projects and ideas he's worked on. Dicaprio is portrayed as a man with some background knowledge on the current situation as he is shown to be an ambassador for the fight against climate change for the United Nations however he is still thirsty for knowledge and answers and this is what ultimately takes him on this journey across the world to see what climate change really looks like. Dicaprio’s argument on what is needed to fight and eventually stop climate change is really helped by the global figures he brings onto his documentary people such as the Pope and President Obama and remarkable and well-credited professionals in the field of climate science. They give a sense of visual respect as these are men and women who are at the top of their fields and of the free and spiritual world respectively. 
           <br><br>
 The underlying message from this video is towards the idea that the Paris Agreement is a good first step but nowhere near enough. The world is dying even now, and there's no way an agreement with no power will be able to enforce the laws needed to make sure that climate change is combated. However, even though the world is currently in dire conditions, the documentary leaves off with a positive undertone that I believe is really important to consider. The world is in a bad place but languishing in regret will get us nowhere and it is through action and cooperation that climate change can and must be stopped.

The film “ Before the Flood” described the experience of Leonardo DiCaprio as the United Nations messenger of peace in the first person. At the beginning of the documentary, it mentioned a painting called “The Garden of Earthly Delights” by Hieronymus Bosch. The painting displayed the relationship between human beings and nature, indicating the harmful consequences of a series of artificial natural changes. Then the documentary mentioned Leonardo’s journal in five continent which shows the serious natural changes made by human. From Leonardo’s experience, the audience can authentically realize that our planet is getting worse and pollutions are everywhere due to massive industries and pollution. I think the documentary is effective at communicating its subject since it shows the truth of climate change. I think the audience of the documentary maybe everyone on the earth since nature protection is vital for individual daily life. Given that the documentary almost covers every continent on the earth, people around the world are able to realize the air pollution, water contamination and deforestation are quite close. It makes them feel concern and nervous about the present and future. For example, it mentions the massive air pollution in Beijing. The audience must be shocked by the fog and smoke that almost cover the camera lens. The pollution can do harm to children’s lungs and impact their future development. Also, the ice melting in Antarctica is also astonishing. People can realize that those animals are endangered because of global warming. After watching the film, I felt both pessimistic and optimistic since our environment has already deteriorated but most people realized the situation and try to take action. For instance, China is working on wind power generation and attempting to replace the use of fossil fuel. Also, many environmental scientists recommend people eat less beef and try to change their eating diet to chicken. Those attempts are human’s positive actions towards climate change.

I feel like the film "Before the Flood" was compelling in deciphering the emergency we are in with the atmosphere since it takes feelings from different alternate points of view that will obviously contact a bigger crowd. There is a republican financial expert, profound fantasies, the assessments of fluctuating nations, and substantially more that obviously gives a wide size of viewpoints on the environmental change issue. I feel like this film worked admirably alarming the general population about the circumstance we are in while additionally giving arrangements the watcher, as an individual, can do today. For myself, I felt profoundly energetic to stop my meat utilization and consider my activities and carbon impression. 
            <br><br>

I respect Leonardo Dicaprio utilizing his notoriety and impact to effectively voice his interests about environmental change and being somebody who will battle for the reason regardless of how unnerving and troublesome. The most educational scene for me was the nasa space traveler, Piers Sellers who had the option to show atmosphere changes impacts on earth from the point of view of room. The wide point of view enables the watcher to see the amazing effect it is having and how muddled the climate changes can be. Notwithstanding his chart, Seller's idealistic message about his all the best for the fate of our atmosphere in spite of his brief timeframe left on Earth was amazingly endearing and effective. He said "I put stock in people" and that stayed with me since I likewise accept people will need what is best for our future. When we move beyond the dread and haze of disarray around environmental change, people will be the arrangement we should be. Fossil fuels have given us accommodation and a superior expectation for everyday comforts; it has likewise created riches for some ventures. Therefore, individuals are hesitant to confront the emergency of environmental change. Seeing this, we should begin from ourselves to urge others to join the way toward hindering a worldwide temperature alteration, to create a better future for tomorrow. :)

When watching the film Before the Flood, I learned just how badly climate change is affecting different areas of the planet. As mentioned in the film, most people think of rising temperatures as the only thing resulting from climate change but it can range to other things such as higher wind speeds that create deadlier tornados and hurricanes. It was a shock to visually see just how much damage we have caused to the planet in such a short amount of time. Early in the film, Leonardo DiCaprio stated, “As an actor, I pretend for a living. I play fictitious characters, often solving fictitious problems. I believe that mankind has looked at climate change, in that same way…” and it made me realize that this is sadly true especially in the United States. People are often lacking knowledge about climate change especially due to our media willing selling their credibility to the people who want the public to be hidden from the truth and thus causing people to believe climate change to be a fake story. DiCaprio is a great example of what kind of person we should all become; someone who may not know much but is willing to learn more to help save our planet so that we and the many generations after us can have a good time on this planet. I understand that we all do not have sources like DiCaprio to learn about climate change and how to fix things but education can be a great start. In China, the government was making conscious efforts to educate its population about climate change and to push for changes to make their emissions of CO2 to decrease heavily. In addition, Sweden was able to push for renewable electricity to the point where they became the first and only country to be fossil fuel free. In my opinion, the saddest part of this whole situation is that the United States has the ability to become fossil fuel free similarly to Sweden but we have not even come close to doing so. In fact, we have been using more and more fossil fuels in the past half a century which has been a time where we have known about climate change. Additionally, anytime that people speak up about climate change, similarly to how DiCaprio spoke up, they get shut down by news outlets and “credible” people and told that climate change is not a real thing. If the United States would do so much as to at least acknowledge that climate change is occurring, I believe that that would cause our country to finally start making a better change for our planet.

The film “Before the Flood” explores a wide variety of causes and effects of climate change. Leonardo DiCaprio is the host and talks to experts in different fields about their experience working to solve or work on the issues the world faces as a result of the climate crisis. The film is very effective in explaining different phenomenon because the experts are talking to DiCaprio as a single person instead of trying to explain to the general public. It makes the experience more personal and easier to understand. The visual of the amount of ice melted was crazy to see and had a larger effect as opposed to just hearing about the amount of ice melted in the past 10 years. It baffled me how so many high-powered politicians and people in power strongly deny climate change and make those who believe in it seem like the “dumb” ones. Another interesting detail is that many influential politicians are payed and given incentives to deny climate change by major oil companies, the same ones who are the major cause of co2 emissions. An important part of the film is when DiCaprio visits India and sees the effects climate change is having there. It is shocking that a certain agricultural area received a year’s amount of rainfall in just 5 hours – destroying all of the crops. As the President of the Palau Islands said, the countries that contribute the least to carbon emissions will be hurt the most. As shown in this film, the prospect of reversing climate change is extremely daunting, but it is better to make changes and put in an effort than to continue as we are now and pass the point of no return.

I also liked the approach that “Before the Flood” took in framing Leonardo DiCaprio as someone simply searching for answers about the climate crisis, and taking us along on the journey. As Ken explained, DiCaprio was certainly more knowledgeable about the issue than he may have admitted, but the structure of following him around the world to hear many perspectives made the film much more captivating and accessible, as it taps into our natural human curiosity. It saddened me to see directly some of the first tragic effects of climate change in India, including the flooded onion fields. Hearing the sadness in the president of Kiribati’s voice as he explained the state’s plan in response to sea level rise similarly made my heart ache for people like his grandchildren, who will likely have to leave the home they have always known. Because this documentary had such a short amount of time to explore so many different aspects of the climate crisis, I believe that the format of learning alongside DiCaprio was an effective strategy to show the audience both the depth and breadth of the issue.

In the film Before the Flood Leonardo Dicaprio sets off to find the answer to his questions regarding climate change. This film had an interesting approach of having someone in the film represent the viewers. Dicaprio plays the role of the viewers by being unaware and learning as he goes from place to place. Like most viewers his profession isn’t familiar with the science of climate change and the consequences of it. Throughout the film, Dicaprio has credible interviewees, such as the former president of the United States, Barack Obama. Obama talked about the Paris Agreement which took place a few years ago where all the countries came together to find a solution to the rapidly increasing temperature. While they came to some decisions, there were no laws set and there was no one set in charge to ensure that the laws were being followed, which is where Dicaprio saw a flaw. Dicaprio deemed the Paris Agreement worthless since none of the countries stuck to their word and there were no changes made on carbon emissions. 
            <br><br>

Before watching the film I was not aware of the fact that the Paris Agreement in 2015 decided to limit carbon emissions to levels that would limit the temperature from rising more than two degrees Celsius about the mark set before the industrial revolution and that they have already reached that limit due to the lack of laws set during the agreement. I believe having Dicaprio represent the viewers was an effective rhetorical device because it allowed it to having a wider viewing audience since they didn’t have to already be educated on the subject to be able to understand the film.

The film, “Before the Flood,” does a really nice job at portraying the effects of climate change throughout the world. As we follow Leonardo DiCaprio on his journey around the world, we get a firsthand experience of the devastation that climate change has caused and what can be done to solve these issues. Being able to visually see how climate change is affecting the world makes it that much easier to understand the issue at hand and drive home the message that something needs to be done.

            <br><br>

The main part of this film that I liked was when Sunita Narain called the US out for their hypocrisy. People tend to blame poorer countries for contributing more to climate change than developed nations because of their larger populations. However, a larger population does not necessarily mean a larger carbon footprint. People  do not realize that the lifestyle of someone in the developing world contributes much less greenhouse gases than the average person in the developed world, especially someone from the US. This is something that Sunita does a really good job at highlighting when she compares the consumption of an average American to the rest of the world. It’s sad that a country as rich as the US is doing less to switch to a cleaner source of energy than the rest of the world. Rather than setting an example for the rest of the world, Americans refuse to change their way of life.

            <br><br>

The other part of this film that stood out to me was the fact that large corporations are buying their way into the government. It is also startling to see how many people are willing to be bought by these companies to deny climate change. I cannot imagine how someone can knowingly deny climate change for the sake of money and not have a second thought that what they are doing is morally wrong and negatively impacting our planet.

Having also watched, "Before the Flood," I absolutely agree with you that the scenes with Dr. Narain are the best parts of the film. Recalling that developed nations have several times the impact on the earth despite developing nations having a much larger population really shows how hypocritical the US can be. I think many people from the US have a sort of mentality where there's a sort of outrage that India and China are also huge polluters, but pressure is on for the US. This film helps people realize that first off, these two nations are polluting so much because they are essentially the US's factories doing our dirty work. If the US could not find poor Chinese and Indian workers, then we would be emitting even more pollution than we already do. Secondly, the figure of 300 million people in India not having access to electricity was just astounding. North Americans are incredibly privileged and I value this film for showing it. 
            <br><br>


I also feel your disbelief at the fact that corporations can buy the opinions and decisions of our governments. It is hard to believe that for a price, people are willing to sell their credentials or authority when this may very well be one of the most important issues of our lifetimes. This convinced me that DiCaprio was the right choice for the UN Ambassador though. Here is a highly recognizable and beloved face of pop culture, taking us along for the journey to understanding climate change. A celebrity, as unknowing as any of the general populace, willing to risk bad publicity on such a serious problem highlights the immorality of those that would let themselves be bought by the fossil fuel industry and similar corporations. 
            <br><br>


A visual that stood out to me was the one DiCaprio compared to Mordor, and that was just the extraction process for oil. This movie is so important in showing the public what climate change looks like, from the melting of Greenland's ice sheet to Kiribati's devastated population. However, I couldn't stop thinking about that field under extraction because all I could think about was what else could have been grown in that spot instead, like forests or food.

Al Gore has made great efforts to try to solve the problem, climate change, which may leads to the sixth extinction. He started off his film by going to Greenland, and he highlighted the severity of climate change by pointing out the glacier is keep melting, and large amount of water is flowing into ocean. Therefore, the sea level will rise, and many coastal cities will be emerged by water. He utilized Miami as an example to illustrate the climate change is a fact. Furthermore, he began to open training program in many countries to tell the people about climate change. He mentioned that developing countries are main sources which produce lots of green house gases. For instance, India is the country which burn coal to produce electricity, and they plan build more power stations which burn coal to get electricity. Al Gore talked with them, but they rebut Al Gore by stating that the US is the developed country which also burn coal in the past to get prosperous. They did not reach an agreement at the end of the meeting. India also expressed that they would not use solar energy in climate change conference in Paris. After hearing that, Al Gore decided to try his best to change India's president's perspective. In the end of this conference, the president of India changed his point of view, because World Bank granted over $1 billion as solar loan. However, all the efforts Al Gore made are invalid since Trump has announced that US quit from the Paris agreement. Nevertheless, Al Gore does not give up, and he is still doing speech to persuade more and more people to take action to solve the problem.
                <br><br>
 In my perspective, it is a good film which expresses that climate change is exist and people should make efforts to deal with it. The film appeal to audience's emotion by showing the scene of flood and the refugees who experienced the disasters. Furthermore, it used data to show that it is necessary to take action now to avoid coastal cities from being drown. It also shows that reusable energy is essential in the future which will replace fossil fuel to support human daily life.

I feel very emotional after watching “An Inconvenient Sequal.” In my perspective, I think this is the best environmental film that I have ever watched. I love a sentence that Al Gore said in the middle of the film, that “anyone who decides to be a part of helping to solve the climate crisis has a constant struggle between hope and despair.” The reason why I love it very much is that it precisely conveys the feeling that I have when I watch the film and the feeling that I have since  I started to learn environmental studies in Engl 22.
                <br><br>



The first part of the film introduced the disasters and the difficulties that Al Gore faced while advocating environmental consciousness. For example, global warming caused the ice sheet melting, resulting in hurricanes and floods in Florida and many other cities, but, when Al Gore try to launch the DSCOVR satellite to raise people’s attention towards the environment change, the plan was canceled. This gives me a feeling of despair because this proves that there are people who are not aware of the seriousness of the situation. Al Gore, then, throws out the fact that there are things that we have successfully developed for protecting the environment, such as renewable energy. This is exciting for people who care about the changes. Unfortunately, there is another turning point that there are countries where they are not willing to spend money on building renewable energy. This is also frustrating. Since I started learning environmental studies, I know that solving the environmental crisis will need the efforts of everyone, at least as much as possible. Though the exciting news is that the president of India eventually decided to join the “Paris Agreement”, at the end of the film, Donald Trump decided to withdraw the US from it.

                <br><br>


Though the ending is sad for annoying people who care about the contribution that a developed country could make towards this problem, I would like to believe and be optimistic. As long as we would like to look to the future and started to act differently now. I think there are chances since a larger proportion of people would like to believe what is right.

I enjoyed the film, "Before the Flood". While it wasn't as informative as the article, "The Uninhabitable Earth", I think it still did a good job at illustrating some of the troubles are planet is currently going through because of climate change, as well as who is causing it. I think the film succeeds at calling the viewers and the world at large to action. That being said, I think I benefited more from reading the news article, because it explained everything that's going on as well as the future we are traveling towards, in a very understandable and explicit fashion.

This is my second viewing of "Before the Flood" and I was able to comprehend and analyze much more during the second viewing. Leonardo shows excellent examples of how climate change has impacted Earth and what could follow. When they are speaking in the northern Canadian arctic, viewers are able to grasp the beauty of the landscape and understand how much ice has melted and what issues arise from it. The documentary mentions and investigates India's worsening air quality crisis that stems from industrial emissions, vehicles and slash and burn agriculture. Without governmental control and regulation, air pollution will not improve but increase around the globe with such a rapidly growing population. The film features countless examples of how human activities are slowly destroying every ecosystem in the entire world. With slow sustainable advancement in the United States, only time will tell if we can reverse the mistakes of the past.

After watching the documentary, "Before the flood', I was shocked to find out that global climate change is not only an environmental problem but a political one. The controversy around climate change is what has kept us from unifying and consequently solving these issues. To my surprise, it is large fossil fuel companies like Exxon and Shell that are lobbying against climate change reform policies. In addition to showing how politics play a role in this crisis, the film shows us current examples of the effects of climate change that include the daytime flooding of Miami, the melting of the polar icecaps, the burning of Indonesian forests and the flooding of crops in India. I believe that the cinematography really captures and exemplifies the harmful effects of this crisis on people. 

                <br><br>

On a more positive note, I was happy to see that changes are happening (although not at the rate that is needed)all around the world. China is one of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter and thankfully they have begun the transition from fossil fuels to fully renewable energy. I was astonished that Sweden is now a fossil fuel-free nation.  I truly hope that films like these, with influential personalities like Pope Francis, Barrack Obama, and Leonardo Decaprio, will bring awareness to the issues that are global warming.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching the documentary "Before the Flood" and thought it was extremely effective in portraying, as Ken puts it, the breadth of the climate crisis. Leonardo DiCaprio, in my opinion, did a phenomenal job travelling to so many different places around the world, speaking to so many different people and gaining a wide variety of perspectives on climate change and its effects. I thought that this style or strategy of presenting the problem of the climate crisis was certainly effective rhetorically and worked well. Something I found very profound was the segment in the film where DiCaprio travelled to India and spoke with Dr Sunita Narain; as Ken also notes, she really hammered the U.S. for our role in greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbating the climate crisis: rightfully so. It made me really feel shameful on behalf of my country, as we are supposed to be the number one superpower of the world, supposedly the greatest nation on the planet, but a large part of the crisis that threatens the future of our planet is directly because of us. 

                <br><br>

I found DiCaprio’s speech at the very end of the film to also be particularly profound and impressive. The scene portraying his whole journey and all of the places he visited during the film, coupled with his simultaneous speech about what he had witnessed at those places, actually gave me goosebumps! Overall though, the documentary was really depressing. It made me feel extremely pessimistic about the future of our world and really doubt that humanity can collectively come together to combat the climate crisis. I felt this especially while watching the ending part about the Paris Climate Agreement, since the film was released in 2016. Obviously since then, Donald Trump has become the President of the United States and announced his intentions to pull America out of the agreement. There’s also the issue that the agreement itself is largely symbolic and, as noted in the film, does not put any solid restrictions on the nations, only states that the nations under the agreement have to work towards target goals, which if I remember correctly, are set by themselves. I think that the climate crisis warrants a much more radical response than this, but that would also be much harder to get so many countries to agree to. Although I am usually more optimistic even with regards to climate change, this documentary definitely put a damper in that and made me feel much more doubtful about our chances to stop climate change before it does some serious, irreversible damage.

While I haven't had the pleasure of watching the preceding film, "An Inconvenient Sequel" is the follow-up film to "An Inconvenient Truth" in which Al Gore continues to emphasize his utmost devotion to the cause of finding solutions to the greatest threat our society has ever encountered: climate change. While "An Inconvenient Truth" is thought to be a revolutionary realization towards the impact of the climate crisis and was one of the first truly ground-breaking moves to bring this issue to the fore-front for much of the unaware public. While it handles many topics, there are a lot of ways in which it is now a bit dated compared to the new discoveries and technologies of today. Hence, "An Inconvenient Sequel" works to show Al Gore and where the climate crisis has reached since his initial outcry. Unsurprisingly, many predictions have become worse and even some of things Al Gore spoke of just over a decade ago, such as the flooding of New York which was perceived to be a huge exaggeration, became a reality in 2012. The film depicts Al Gore visiting many different locations, points of great contingency in his initial film, such as Greenland where the glaciers are melting, Florida where the streets are submerged, and most importantly France in which the Paris Agreement he strove so hard to achieve, then taken all down at the end of the film at the hands of President Trump.
                <br><br>

I've also watched "Before the Flood," a film documenting the stresses of climate change through the adventures of Leonardo DiCaprio after being selected as the U.N. Ambassador of Peace. Both "An Inconvenient Sequel" and "Before the Flood" discuss at lengths the troublesome impacts climate change are having even today, however the two celebrities take quite varying approaches in conveying this message. Regarding Al Gore's impressive talent at communication, he speaks very eloquently and emphatically about the issue. He clearly knows his way around presenting these topics in such a convincing manner. Most of his presentation is focused primarily around the emotional impact. Leonardo DiCaprio, while also having emotionally evoking scenes, does have many scientific facts in order to support his cause. While by no means unaware of the situation, at the time of filming DiCaprio goes in with a less knowledgeable understanding, gradually getting a better grasp as the film progresses and his adventure unravels. Gore tends to be more direct, while DiCaprio speaks in some metaphors. These two films are both amazingly influential and a huge testament to the celebrities' attentiveness to this global crisis.

The film "Before the Flood" is simply an eye-opening film for a crucial, real-life topic-climate crisis. I recommend others to watch this documentary film, especially due to the fact that others are simply not educated on what is happening around the world. Throughout the film, Leonardo DiCaprio includes visuals of several of the different natural catastrophes/disasters that have occurred throughout decades, as well as, throughout the world. It is very evident that due to the fact that DiCaprio takes up the subject of climate crisis to political figures, he takes the subject very importantly. With even making this documentary, he is simply determined to make a change in the world to solve this crisis even if it seems out of his--and much so ours--control. DiCaprio includes: "Try to have a conversation with anyone about climate change, people just tune out." which I completely agree with. Not only are people uneducated about the problems our world faces, they also ignore the subject when brought up. This sad fact shows how much individuals care about our planet and its future. Many news outbreaks were made that having DiCaprio "educate world leaders on made up climate change [...]" was taken up as a joke; although, many did not understand how determined and motivated he was to make a change in climate crisis. In my opinion yes, he is a well-known celebrity, so it might look like a joke, but if he did not take upon the position on trying to better our world, who would have? It is inspiring that a well-known individual who is known for acting, actually takes charge and voices out to try to make a change in our lives. It is evident that climate crisis and global warming is not taken as a joke by DiCaprio due to simply traveling around the world to see and talk to others about the negative natural changes that are occurring in different countries. Many are blinded by the fact that global warming is happening and is bringing upon a pessimistic future for all of us. In the film, Jackson expresses: "What we've done to the rest of the world is just--it's criminal." With expressing this, Jackson showcases the fact that everything that occurs-good or bad-can only happen because of us, individually. It is simply important to take charge and take action in helping our world. This film gives a good amount of information for those who are unaware of what is actually going on in our world.

In the film “Before the Flood” has a particularly interesting introduction to the film by presenting Hieronymus Bosch painting, The Garden of Earthly Delights. Leonardo DiCaprio interprets the painting as a visual representation of humanity's descent into a version of hell on Earth. The painting depicts chaos, death, and fire, all engulfed in darkness. We cannot deny that the painting indeed predicts a prophecy that is in its beginning phase as of right now. Around the world, wildfires are destroying habitats and homes leaving behind a trail of death and destruction. The pollution of the ocean caused by oil rigs, leaves gallons of black oil on the surface of the ocean that vanishes animal life from that region. The rise of sea level has and will continue to displace a large portion of the population who have no alternative but to migrate inwards in search of security. 
                <br><br>

To address the primary issue of rising sea levels, I find it quite fascinating how the state of Florida is paying millions of millions of the public's tax dollars to build an infrastructure that will protect the coastline from flooding. The necessary precautions are to secure the longevity of the cities and of the people’s homes. Yet this is only a temporary solution to a problem that will get a hundred times worse by the following decade. If it is not for the rising sea levels, Florida will be wiped out of existence by massive hurricanes. 
                <br><br>

Furthermore, scientists have predicted what may occur if the necessary measurements to stop climate change are not met. These include higher temperatures in already warm areas or the drop in temperature in Europe, for example. However, scientists who speak on the issue of climate change are vilified, scrutinized, harassed and black listed by politicians and fellow colleagues for “dramatizing” a natural occurrence of the planet. Prior to watching the film I was not aware of the backlash scientists receive by reporting and speaking about climate change, such as receiving death rates for reporting facts not made aware of before. However, I did know and I strongly agree that the government is corrupt. Politicians purposely oppose any policies meant to minimize the carbon footprint of the United States is responsible for because they have a personal agenda to secure first. These politicians are bribed by large fossil fuel companies to deny climate change and oppose any legislation from limiting their production of more fossil fuel. Although this is not news to me, it continues to blow my mind of how cynical and disgusting these politicians are. They lie to the people, tell them everything is alright, in order to gain money. For what reason? If we do not address the climate crisis, those millions of dollars they secure in their pockets will become worthless pieces of paper.

I also watched the film “Before the Flood”, and similarly appreciated that the painting was a good comparison to what our future looks like. DiCaprio finds a way to make a connection to the current climate change issue to his personal life. The painting by Bosh was above his crib as a baby, and now as an adult uses it to show the viewers the sad truth behind not acting in taking care of our planet. As you stated, the painting is indeed a way of demonstrating a prophecy that awaits all of humankind if we don’t fix our actions. 
                <br><br>
The scene in which Florida shows how it took action in transforming areas to help with flooding is what many other places need to take influence from. Another scene in which an action is presented but not implemented is what Elon Musk describes as switching to battery power. It was interesting to see the enthusiasm and idea presented but in this case, it is something that people in power need to help make happen because Musk states its expensive to actually realize. The fact that we only need 100 of the battery locations around the world was shocking to hear, but again the reality of it actually happening is not so convincing unfortunately. 
                <br><br>



I completely agree with you in terms of how saddening it is to see scientist who dedicate their lives to climate change be harasses and disrespected by others. It is not shocking that this happens and is only expected by those who are selfish and in power like politicians that disregard the well-being of poor folks. Politicians who oppose climate change could never understand what poor people face due to what those in power enable.

I thought the documentary "Before the flood" perfectly explains many aspects of climate change from different perspective all over the world. The fact that in just 20 years we will be able to sail across the North pole is a terrifying fact that instantly woke me up to the severity of this crisis and the speed at which it is happening. This documentary showed me that the most problematic issue relating to climate change is the lack of awareness of the situation. Many politicians, governors and word leaders deny the science behind climate change therefore blocking any laws to be put in place to stop the use of fossil fuels such as a carbon tax. This is a prime example in Florida, a state already suffering the consequences of climate change, and paying millions of dollars to protect it's people and infrastructure from the rising of sea levels. If leaders do not face the reality of climate change they will not invest in renewable energy and keep using fossil fuels, and will eventually pay the consequences. 
                <br><br>


Although at first I was wondering what Leonardo DiCaprio could teach me about the climate crisis, it was very interesting to see him learn more and more about this crisis throughout this documentary. i admire his dedication to the topic and I believe that seeing him in this documentary may attract a different audience which otherwise would not have watched this. He has become a good ambassador for climate change and use his platform as an actor to raise awareness on this topic. The more people are educated on climate change the more they will make positive changes in their lives to reduce their own carbon footprint. But awareness goes beyond small personal sacrifices, the more this issue is talked about and understood the more pressure will be put on the government to change the production of energy and transport, and hopefully stop the momentum of climate change before the consequences become critical.

In the film, Leonardo DiCaprio explores the environmental damage. It is caused by many human activities in the world.Situation of global warming is affected by climate change in various countries. Leonardo seeks solutions, from renewable energy to preventing the continuous rise of sea level.
                <br><br>

First of all, as the guide and narrator of the story, Leonardo's personal experience and the trend of global warming are closely linked in this film. There are not only the intuitive feelings of personal consciousness, but also the grand presentation of world changes.With the development of the documentary, Leonardo travels around the world and communicates with people who have lofty ideals. This behavior has guided the further deepening of the theme and revealed the causes behind global warming. As an image ambassador, Leonardo has always been charged with the task of finding solutions. In the first half of the film, Leonardo's experience of environmental protection in his youth and his exploration of the present situation are switched back and forth, highlighting the deepening of his exploration and understanding of the concept of environmental protection.
                <br><br>

Secondly, as a film with the theme of "global warming crisis is coming", it is necessary to advocate this theme to some extent. In the film, in order to support this view, the theme is strengthened by criticizing the "anti climate warming" people and presenting their "ugly faces". Through the rapid switching of news reports and speech videos, the documentary shows a large group of "science fraudsters" who disregard science for their interests. In particular, the superb visual effect production has achieved good results in showing that members of Congress receive money and defend oil tycoons.

“Before the Flood” was a very effective film for me. I think that while readings, articles, and statistics do have an impact, literally seeing the environments and the people the climate crisis is directly impacting, the way they live, and how their livelihoods are changed by rising sea levels, irresponsible carbon/gas emissions, deforestation, and corporate greed have a much more significant impact. It makes something that through reading seems very distant, feel very personal and immediate- which I feel is what the film aimed to do.
                 <br><br>
I found the moment where they saw the farmland that had been flooded and destroyed in 5 hours of abnormal rain particularly striking- it showed how the climate crisis is directly impacting the lives and livelihoods of the poor/people living in developing countries. It forced us to acknowledge that the consequences of the climate crisis we are learning about aren't in the distant future- they're happening now.
                <br><br>
I thought it was a smart move to choose Leonardo DiCaprio as the “protagonist” of this film because since he is such an iconic public figure, he brings a large following/wide variety of people into the audience to watch the film, educating a wider audience than if it was a lesser-known public figure. He is also very passionate on the subject and has a long track record of activism that more than proves that he cares about this subject. Also, since many people view him as a role model, they will feel more interested and motivated to get more involved in solving the climate crisis. I felt the “Before the Flood” production team did a good job helping the audience feel like they were on a team with DiCaprio, as he was learning this information about the climate crisis at the same time the audience does. 
                <br><br>
I also appreciated that the film accepted and discussed criticism about the USA's contributions to the climate crisis, instead of trying to paint the USA as a perfect model of how to solve it.

The film, "Before the Flood", has showed the audience the terrible effects of global warming, how global warming affect different areas around the world, and how it influence different people. It is not easy to believe how dramatic the causes of global warming is, until I have visually saw this film, showing me directly how the glacier melt in such a short time and we are the reason why this happened. Also, the city of Miami flooding of ocean water. 
                <br><br>

Though we worked hard to develop environmental friendly energy sources such as solar energy, it is expensive for poor countries for example India to consume. To save the world we are facing a dilemma that it is unfair to prevent other developing countries from using coals, even though we realize that it will cause bigger problems in the future. Still, it is hard for everyone to take action to protect our world.
                <br><br>

After watching this film, I really hope there will be more people bravely stand out to face, discuss, and solve this serious problem human beings are suffering, and will suffer more obviously in the future. Everyone should feel to be part of it, thus the earth will treat us same as how we treat it. Hopefully, things will get better when people over the world all work together to slow down the speed of global warming.

For this film I have some opinions about carbon tax.you can't change the way of life of the Americans with the highest carbon emissions; you can't persuade the developing countries to mine low-cost coal for energy in order to improve people's livelihood; you can't prevent businessmen from giving up the expansion of palm tree planting area for profit; you can't change the eating habits and culture of Americans eating beef in the short term So as to reduce the scale of cattle raising. The causes of climate warming are so complex that we can't simply rely on people's sense of social responsibility and moral self-discipline to solve the problem.
                <br><br>
Mankun, is interviewed in the film. His solution is to levy a carbon tax on carbon emissions, which leads to the price rise. Therefore, reduce people's use and use economic leverage to guide people's behavior.Taxing bad activities forces people to face up to these costs. Because people's lives are very complex, there are many things to worry about, and they don't want to think about climate change every time they make a decision. The function of taxation is to help them move in the right direction. Li asked Mankiw, as the government's economic adviser, why didn't the policy be implemented as soon as possible? Mankiw's answer is interesting:The reason Obama didn't dare to include a carbon tax in his campaign speech was that he was worried about the negative impact of the polls on him. In order to change politicians' views on carbon tax, we must first change the public's views on carbon tax. Politicians and elected leaders are actually our elected followers. They do what the people want them to do. Once the people are convinced, politicians will soon follow suit.
                <br><br>
People need to have a correct understanding of the carbon tax, levy carbon tax, and reduce other taxes, such as payroll tax, to implement tax transfer rather than increase taxes.

The documentary before the flood is one of the most impressing movie about global warming I have even watched. The movie use a perspective that draws close connection with the audiences. It does not start with the shocking facts and scary number to show the importances with this issue. Instead it starts with people do not believe this issue is true which is very common thoughts for most of us. 
                <br><br>
At the beginning of this movie, it uses the real examples to show how today's situation is. The large burning forests and the ice-cream melting north pole all pointing out the situation is true and serious.
                <br><br>


After showing all these facts, it lead to the most common question for most of people " If it is really that bad, why a lot of people still do not act and still do not believe it?" I really like this question because it gives a feeling that the director stands with the audiences. This movie is not telling the audiences what the director wants to tell them, instead it is answering the questions that audiences want to ask. All the cold facts about money and benefit of fossil fuel industry such as shell, chevron and so on. What is more sad is that, everyone nowadays know about this issue is real, 97% of scientists  agree on this issue and back to 1900s scientist propose the argument that CO2 can cause rising temperature. And we also have the solution that Elon Musk said if we use more clean form of energy such as solar, only 100 solar station would produce sufficient energy for the whole world. However the sad fact is that all the oil industry do not want to give up their benefit so we choose to not solve this issue. 

                <br><br>

A good question is proposed that "do we really want to know the truth?" the fact is even we know the truth, do we choose to believe it or find excuses for us to ignore it and lie to ourselves for the money?

Prior to watching “Before the Flood”, I didn’t know that Leonardo DiCaprio was the main protagonist. I do recall a period of time where I was hearing people make comments about DiCaprio as an environmentalist, stating that he shouldn’t talk so much about something he doesn’t know anything about. I find that take on him kind of odd because there’s a good amount of people criticizing him that aren’t doing anything to contribute to change. I also want to note how crucial I believe it is for environmentalists who have large platforms to use that platform to not only bring awareness, especially by using hard facts. You don’t have to have a scientific background to bring awareness and take a stand in regards to climate change. I do believe it can be helpful when analyzing certain topics though. 
                <br><br>

Sunita Narain does an excellent job at presenting the reality of how much America’s energy consumption is versus other countries. DiCaprio seems to try and bring up how perhaps if America invested in more solar energy, things would be better, but Narain reminds him that America is extremely addicted to fossil fuels. She also emphasizes that countries cannot fight against climate change if they don’t believe it exists first. Narain’s emphasis on how countries need to actually believe that climate change exists sticks with me more after I finished the film and remembered the facts presented about how U.S. politicians and the oil industry are connected. The fact that a U.S. chairman makes almost 2 million dollars from the oil industry makes me feel like, it’s not that these countries don’t believe that climate change is happening, it’s just that the government profits from organizations such as big oil and gas industries.  There's a film about the Maldives that highlights former president Mohamed Nasheed and his efforts to bring action to climate change as his country is being heavily impacted by sea-level rise, and I thought of this as well after the film because he is an example of how our government should be. But it seems that, because of greed, there is a lack of action.
                <br><br>

Going back to DiCaprio, I see the controversy regarding his carbon footprint is pretty big, but after seeing how much diet contributes to climate change and after learning that DiCaprio is a vegan, I don’t know if his footprint is as large anymore. From lecture we discussed how much a plant-based diet helps versus say driving an electric car, so I don’t think people should downplay DiCaprio as much as they do. After being presented with how much our lifestyle (especially diet) could truly change things around in "Before the Flood", I feel urged to make some changes in mine.

Before learning about Leonardo DiCaprio’s experience and qualifications, I too questioned his credibility as UN Messenger of Peace. However, after watching “Before the Flood,” I also found his position to be effective. Like DiCaprio, most of us are not climatologists or experts in the environment. His vulnerability makes it easier for us to relate to his views on the climate crisis and follow some of his solutions. By demonstrating that someone who started out with little scientific knowledge on the issue is able to educate himself and make changes, DiCaprio is effective in encouraging everyday people like us to do the same. Rather than being intimidated by the enormity of the problem or thinking that we need to be experts in order to take action, the documentary shows how it is possible for anyone to become informed and start working on solutions. For example, the fact that you feel urged to make changes to your lifestyle reflects the powerful influence DiCaprio has on us. Furthermore, this documentary revealed manageable solutions to reduce our carbon footprint, such as reducing our consumption of beef and buying less fast fashion. These are small lifestyle changes that nearly everyone can adopt, but accumulate into a larger positive impact when enough people do them.

<p>
Leonardo Dicaprio's use of selective ignorance while starring in the film "Before the Flood" is an effective rhetorical tool because it allows him to draw on the empathy of the viewers. By embodying the potential feelings and beliefs of the viewers, DiCaprio convinces them to empathize with him and pay more attention to his message.

I felt that one of the most effective aspects of the documentary “Before the Flood” was the way it showed the effects of climate change in other parts of the world. I think that in the United States it is very easy to become complacent. Yes, many US cities and states have suffered because of climate change (here in California, the fires are an excellent example) but after the fires are put out and the storms pass by, it is easy to just go back to your daily life and forget about what happened. Especially for people living in areas that remain largely unaffected, like our UCSB campus. It’s important that we see the smog in China and the lack of electricity in India. I also appreciated the way that our country was called out for calling itself a leader, and yet failing to lead the fight against climate change. 
                <br><br>

Another part of the film that I found extremely effective was when they talked about the effect that cows have on our environment. I already try to limit my meat consumption as much as possible (usually to maybe twice per week) but I was watching the film with a friend, and by the end of it he said he wants to cut beef out of his diet. The statistic that we only use 1% of agricultural land for the food that we eat, and essentially the rest to grow feed for the cows, was incredibly striking. I had to press pause and really think about that before moving on. It’s a completely ridiculous statistic, and it’s scary to believe that it’s true.

I agree that the eye-opening experience of seeing other parts of the world and how people, animals, and home are being destroyed and affected there was one of the biggest impacts of the films. I think it is so important to look outside of our country to really get a grasp on the climate crisis. It is so easy to live in the US and experience our economy and turn a blind eye to the climate crisis; the sad part is, even people in other countries are mad at the US for the way in which we live and continue to live. The lack of electricity in India was mind-boggling to me and after watching this film, I just feel straight up guilty for how we live and continue to live without even thinking about all the other countries in the world who are experiencing the worst of the climate crisis because, mainly, our economy...How do you think the US should spread the word and make it impossible for politicians to ignore how we are affecting developing countries?


<br><hr>
I agree with your take on the crisis and how blind Americans can be towards such a critical issue. It's disappointing to know that our country is digging oil and releasing a surplus of co2 of greenhouse gasses out into the atmosphere while the poor countries who have little to no say in this are the ones suffering the most. in like manner, I could not believe when we found out that countries like India and China are contributing far more towards solar energy than the United States. Our country is too caught up in this capitalistic mindset that our leaders see supporting the climate crisis as a loss of money rather than a means for survival. The political tension that comes with the simple phrase "climate change" is also discouraging. The fact that Florida's own senator can't even acknowledge the existence of climate change creates a division amongst political parties when unity is what we truly need to solve such a big issue. In terms of your comment on dietary changes, I too have limited my consumption of red meat. After watching the film and coming to realize that 12 percent of carbon emissions caused by cow farts, I am now even more convinced to switch to a heavy plant-based diet. More than that after watching this film and sitting through a few of Ken's lectures i feel the need to go out and preach this information like the gospel to all of my friends and family. Little things such as changing our diet can go a long way in the grand scope of things.



<br><Hr>
I agree with your views on the video as I had I similar take on it as well. Just like you mentioned, I was also glad that the U.S. was called out for not taking a lead in creating change for our planet. It's sad to see how our actions are affecting undeveloped countries the most, when they are not emitting nearly as much greenhouse gases into the environment as we are. If only this country were to recognize the drastic effects it is causing for other countries and made more laws and regulations for companies to follow in regards  to their CO2 emissions. Just like your friend I was also inspired to reduce my beef intake as it is one of the leading emitters of CO2 in the U.S. Things like changing our diets can lead to change if many people are willing to give up this part of their lifestyle.
<br><Hr>

I agree that this film did an exemplary job at showing a breath of different climate change issues throughout different parts of the world. I also find it interesting that you point out the two parts in the film where I felt DiCaprio wasn't as hopeful as compared to other scenes, when he responded with something along the lines of "Well. Americans just wont agree to that and the best thing to do is invest in wind and solar," dismissing the lady's point and saying "do you really think Americans can cut out beef, given that is it so engrained in our culture?" This just shows how we need to work as a team to critique, analyze and push each other to making the right choices to avoid further abuse to our planet.
                <br><br>

The other visual tools the film uses like the hose in Greenland, the view of the palm oil plantations in Indonesia and the satellite mapping at NASA make me even more frustrated at the politicians and news outlets who deny human caused climate change, because how can you deny that evidence and call it a hoax? As stated in the film, we no longer have the liberty nor time to debate climate change. But, it is difficult and defeating to feel hopeful about taking action when officials in Florida get banned from using the words "climate change," when members of congress are bought out by fossil fuel corporations to block bills, and when the U.S. pulls from the Paris Agreement. 
                <br><br>

However, I do appreciate DiCaprio's call to action when he states," We have the means to stop the devastation, bu tno the political will to do so." A lot of climate change is scary to believe that it's true as you admit, but I think we can no longer afford to doubt its full effect. Unlike the article for this week, the film's ending shows us how we can personally contribute to reversing climate change which I definitely appreciated, because it made the crisis feel less inevitable. And I think after realizing that climate change is a problem, we need to next realize that it also doesn't have to be inevitable so we can be the catalysts for change.
<br><Hr>

I'm on board with your mentioning of the the climate crisis only being considered within the bounds of the United States. I as well agree with the importance of contextualizing the issue in a global setting because it's a GLOBAL issue. This is why I feel politics are distorting the crisis when they can be used in tandem with global initiatives to combat the effects of climate change. I'm happy the film discusses dietary consumption as a huge factor in the climate crisis; the reality of the situation is that humans, especially in the United States and other developed countries, have manipulated food growth in an unnatural manner to create an unnecessary supply of  food by manufacturing artificial settings for food, exploiting other countries in the world,  and using an intangible amount of resources to feed a capitalistic, money hungry (lol) industry. I'm curious about the best approach necessary for raising awareness for these issues, as simply stating the truth calls for death threats and negligence.
<br><Hr>
The way the film portrayed the issue in different parts of the world was also one of the most critical aspects of this film for me personally, and I think a huge part of what makes this film so impactful. We are experiencing fires and then returning to business as usual as if nothing has happened because we still have that luxury in most of the U.S. Others do not have these luxuries and it is key that we become aware of the way others live as a result of our inaction. To this same point, I think the film does a good job of identifying the greed within the fossil fuel industry and their buyouts within the political mechanisms of the country that are controlling our policy and making it impossible to get any emission reductions bill through Congress. We cannot begin to address our emission issues if our own government has been bought out by the industry. 
                <br><br>


Furthermore, the same corporate driven and federally supported information runs rampant throughout the agricultural and food production industries that contribute massive amounts of carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere. All of this so that we can feed the cows that we will then eat. One of the single most impactful things a person can do for reducing their carbon footprint is to cut meat and/or dairy from their diet. Instead of eating the cows that eat the grain, why not just eat the grain directly and remove cow from the equation, thereby eliminating the need for additional grain for feed. Many cultures do not eat meat or eat very little, and as one of the major contributing nations to climate change, this is one easy change we can make that will have a major impact on our contribution.

"Before the Flood":  When watching this film I had a lot of mixed feelings. It started off by saying it was sponsered by national geographic which is a pretty big organization, meaning that a lot of money went into making the film. Also the main actor was Leonardo DiCaprio who also is a big time actor. with someone like leonardo acting in a movie it can either be seen as good or bad. For example he is a big figure in society so a lot of people can be influenced by his words which in the case of the movie were very important and he has organizations like the Leonadro foundation which donates millions each year to Climate change problems but i didnt like the fact that in the movie he was wearing very expensive sunglasses and owns yachts and expensive real estate when American consumerism is a big problem and then discuses the problems of american spending inteh film. Besides that fact I think that the message he was getting across is the most important part and the message itself was very crucial and needed to be heard from all populations. I like all the different veiwpoints that the movie took such as speaking to politicians, talking to different scientists, and also talking to people in different countries. I think by doing this he was able to grab veiw points from many angels and fully support his argument. The film was attentive to all aduiences and really was used to hear the words of those in the world around us. Overall I think the film had good purpose and was able to effectily get across a very important message.

In the documentary "An Inconvenient Sequel", AI Gore addresses the current circumstance of global warming. At the beginning of the documentary, Gore went to Greenland and witnessed the melting of the glacier. The scale of the glacier is still vivid in 20 years, but now there are a lot of holes in the glacier, which has caused the melting of the glacier. Immediately after, Gore elaborated on the situation in Miami: flooding the streets, suggesting the real existence of global warming. Gore's climate leader training has impressed me. From the first training, only 500 people listened, and now Gore has been giving lectures around the world, and environmental issues have gradually been recognized and valued. The clean energy that Gore mentioned in the training center, such as wind and solar energy, is very feasible in my opinion. Solar energy requires very little investment, which is suitable for vigorous development and can perfectly replace carbon emissions.
                 <br><br>

I am very happy to see what happened at the Paris Peace Conference. Countries around the world stood together for the same goal, environmental issues, and worked hard for a common goal. For the talks between Gore and the Indian Prime Minister, I am grateful for his contribution to world environmental protection. Of course, I also understand that the Indian President ’s decision not to accept solar energy and choose carbon emissions is the safest way for a developing country. In short, environmental issues are being valued by the world and the results are moving in an optimistic direction.
                 <br><br>

"An Inconvenient Sequel" is worth watching. This documentary tells the current situation of global warming and gives humans a reasonable solution.

At the beginning of the film “Before the Flood”, it starts off with Leonardo DiCaprio talking about this painting which plays a significant role at the end. The painting was painted by Hieronymus Bosch in the 1500s and was named “The Garden of Earthly Delights”. The painting consisted of 3 panels. The first panel contained the world at the beginning of its creation with Adam and Eve as the only human beings. The 2nd panel is where it begins to get a little dark and involves the infusion of deadly sins and overpopulation. Finally, on the 3rd panel is DiCaprio describes as “nightmarish” where everything seemed to be catastrophic. After seeing the film, you can easily tell why it relates to our current situation and why DiCaprio brought it up. The UN Messenger of Peace, Leonardo DiCaprio, speaks amongst many high authority officials at a conference addressing the climate change problem. The thing that really bothered me was that after the conference, the media immediately criticized him, because they didn’t believe in climate change even though it was in fact very real. A scientist that traveled with Leo to the arctic said that by 2040, we’ll be able to sail over the North Pole. The Arctic plays an important role on Earth, because it acts as an air conditioner for the northern hemisphere. If that were to disappear, it would cause severe weather patterns and make floods and droughts more catastrophic. 97% of scientists believe that the Earth is warming, leading our climate to change, which is due to fossil fuel burning and other human activities. The reason there’s quite a few people that don’t believe in it is because of the media and politics. Politics plays a big role in the whole climate change ordeal. There are many politicians don’t believe in climate change, which leads their followers to also follow their beliefs. Some politicians only disagree with the fact that climate change exists, because big oil companies bribe them, so they can keep business running. Fossil fuel companies will do anything to keep their wealth. Later on in the film, it began to transition in tone; from negative to positive. The introduced a solution, such as renewable energy, which some countries have converted to 100% such as Denmark. Another solution that would help would be a non-beef diet, such as chicken. Beef is one of the most inefficient uses of resources on our planet. Switching to chicken from beef will have eliminated 80% of what one emits. Other solutions that were thought of was a carbon tax. It would basically be a tax on any kind of activity that put carbon into the atmosphere. This taxes would lead to a decrease in CO2 consumption. The problem is getting so much worse that Greenland, for the first time, is melting on its entire surface to the point where, instead of being a white surface, becomes a dark surface, and instead of being a cooler, becomes a self-heater, because it can no longer reflect sunlight, only absorb it. This is when sea levels begin to rise. This becomes to be considered as a national security issue, because as sea levels rise, people begin to migrate, which leads to resources becoming scarce, which would inevitably subject to competition between populations. But the most important thing I learned about this film was having faith in humanity which was mentioned near the end of the film. In conclusion, there is a possibility that there is still hope and that we must have faith. We must end our lack of political will to stop this devastation. All of us must take responsibility for our actions and trust each other. It’s all up to us.

I agree with your view that the reason there’s quite a few people that don’t believe in it is because of the media and politics. Although many conservative politicians state they do not believe in climate change, it seems as if they only make this point to benefit them economically and keep their political power through the support of allying with major fossil fuel extraction companies. Like Daniel had mentioned, they say they are in disbelief of climate change, because big oil companies bribe them in return to keep their business running with high profits. It is clear that within the next century, it is likely that we will run out of these fossil fuels that are so lucrious to our economy. However, that is not a problem for these politicians, who belong to older generations, as they will be long gone. They are then pushing extremely devastation problems onto those who have come after them and will come after them. Because of their selfishness, they will create a planet that is unhabitable in the future for those who will be suffering to survive in it, or die because of it.

I believe that the film “Before the Flood” did an excellent job of bringing awareness to the climate crisis and how it is affecting people across the world in devastating ways. I was unaware of Leonardo Dicaprio’s position as the UN Messenger of Peace and was delighted to witness his dedication to educating himself on the truth of the climate crisis. The film brought a lot of harsh realities to light that in my opinion were very effective in getting the message across. Every single action we make has a consequence. For example, when the film highlighted how much consumption goes into just half of a hamburger astonished me. The amount of products I consume and own that contain palm oil honestly makes me feel guilty. It puts my own decisions into perspective and I hope to become as aware as I can be moving forward because I can control my decisions as a way to be apart of the solution. I enjoyed that the film explored various different perspectives on the issues such as a Republican economist, countries like India or China, because it gave me new insight to how others view the issue and ways they believe it can be solved. 

                 <br><br>

This film also showed me how lucky I am at this time. Realistically, I do not consciously feel the consequences of the climate crisis or have felt any change in my lifestyle due to it. Unfortunately, I do know friends and family who have been affected by the wildfires in Northern California and the hurricanes in Florida, but never myself when it easily could have been. Sometimes I think people do not believe in the climate crisis because it is not affecting them yet, and if no action is taken eventually all of our lives are going to change whether we want to fix it or not. It makes me even more sad and angry when people try to deny it because the film clearly showed that this has been affecting every part of the world for a long time, and killing certain parts of it. Putting faces to the victims of these tragedies really struck me and even provoked an emotional response. I try to have faith in humanity and that enough of us will believe to make change and create a solution.

I completely agree with you. The film really did bring out a lot of harsh realities into the light. Similarly, when I learned  how much goes into making a burger, I was shocked. I also think that the film was  extremely effective in conveying a sense of urgency and determination. Leonardo DiCaprio's passion to spread awareness of climate change is absolutely inspiring. It is perfect that he is the face of this documentary considering his enormous wealth and influence. His message is powerful and drives a powerful message. I am sure that just like me, other  students will be left feeling inspired and educated. Being able to eat  meat is definitely  not worth the amount of  carbon emissions it produces. The film really put into perspective of how much carbon emissions each person makes a day. This film also  made me  realize how lucky  I am to be born in this era and not like 2070. Right now,  we don't really directly feel the consequences of the climate crisis. We all definitely need  to take  action if  we hope to  have a sustainable future.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with you in saying eating meat, in my opinion particularly beef, is not worth the amount of carbon emissions it produces. I, myself, have eaten a plant based diet off and on for about year. Initially, I wanted to limit my dairy consumption to hopefully eliminate the negative consequences it had on my skin and body, but after learning more and more on my own about the climate crisis prior to enrolling to this class I became committed to the diet. Since then, I never pressured others to go plant based because I understand that for many its not possible, inaccessible, or some other personal reasons. However, I always encourage those to challenge themselves to limit their beef consumption as much as possible or switch out beef for another meat source. For example, I know some friends who have made it habit to have "Plant based Wednesdays" or no meat for at least 3/7 days of the week. In this way, people can make small steps to cutting their beef consumption without it feeling like a burden. Realistically, it would be great if everyone cut beef all together, but unfortunately that is just not realistic in my eyes. I am happy that I have inspired at least a few people to start their transition away from beef.

After having watched the film, Before the Flood, I was let in complete and utter shock. I am a visual person who when sees things comprehends and understand better. So, to be able to see the air quality in China, or how fast the ice is metling and pouring into the ocean, or how much the islands are already affected by the rising in sea level was completly eye opening and shocking. I was left with a feeling of guilt being an Americnan who has contributed to this rapid change in the global climate that is already affecting the people like the islanders who have such a small ecological footprint comapred to mine and other US citzens, they dont desrve this. From these occurances to the forrsts in Indonesia being completely exploted at the cost of plam oil, to how much out diet and lifestyle plays a role is shocking and much like the Wallace Well’s “The Uninhabitle Earth” is a wake-up call to humanity. 
                  <br><br>
In my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent in the film and I truly did enjoy the rhetoical decice used as we were learning alongside him in his journey. I felt that that it made it more captivating than just a boring documentary, more of an adventure or quest to find “The truth about the threat of climate change”. Judging from my deep interest in the film I beleive I did want to know the truth about the threat of climatge change and after seeing the film it has shocked as well as inspired me.

1. Film (Before the Flood): Watching “Before the Flood”, I found one of the most astounding aspects to be DiCaprio’s reference to “The World Before the Flood” painting that hung above his bed as a child. I find it to be a wonderfully shocking, ironic, and eerily accurate depiction of the anthropogenic consequences of overindulgence occurring in the future, as well as a compliment to the structure of the film itself. As far as the information put forth in the film goes, I would find it hard for anyone not believing in climate change to watch it and remain unchanged. I appreciated the mixture of hard facts balanced with interviews and media of the personal side- people who’s lives are already being impacted by the crisis. I must also praise “Before the Flood” for it’s presentation of smaller issues as well, such as the human’s reaction to news it doesn’t like. To hear the disbeliever’s broadcasts, or the death threats made to researchers by those not believing, coupled with the backing of fossil-fuel-companies disappointed my faith in humanity to an all-time low. I can’t help but ponder what is going on in the workings of the leaders of the large companies shown to be doing the most damage to the environment, and try with little success to understand how money can blind people to such an extent.

I really like and agree with this comment's analysis of the film's structure as well as the personal take on the issue. I agree that the mix of hard facts as well as interviews really drives the point home. It not only helps convince people that climate change is real, but also create a compelling story to follow. I feel as though most people don't like explicitly being told about issues and being in a way 'blamed', so introducing scenes where we follow an amicable actor such as Dicaprio 'discover' these issues helps circumvent any bias we have in engaging the issue. I also appreciate your comments regarding how leaders at large companies are being blinded by the profits from the fossil fuel industries as this is one of the biggest messages the documentary is trying to convey. Dicaprio doesn't hold back from calling out those specifically in charge of keeping industry titans in check: politicians. To add to what you've said: I'm really glad a documentary of this caliber is on Netflix and easily accessible my the masses. In an age of instant, fast paced and high quality content easily available at our fingertips, having something both fun to watch and informative is really the key to reaching out to people who would otherwise not go out of their way to learn more about these issues. Both having it appear so film like as opposed to more of a classic documentary and having a great actor such as Dicaprio further helps towards this goal.


<br><hr>
I agree with you that the film, “Before the Flood,” really makes it difficult for a viewer to not believe in climate change. The film exposed me to a broader view on climate change that I was not aware of. Through Leonardo Dicaprio, I  was able to see different parts of the world heavily affected by climate change. It is absolutely devastating that people can not breathe in China and that islands are being flooded to a point that they might not exist in the future. The film incorporates the views people have on climate change and it is absolutely astounding that there are still people that do not believe in climate change and therefore, nothing is being done about the pressing issue. 
                  <br><br>
The interviews that Dicaprio has with different people around the world give hard facts about how rising sea levels will affect us and how small changes is all that we need. One of the interviewees even stated that eating chicken instead of beef incredibly lowers the amount of CO2 that goes into the air. This movie surprised me in a good way; the film captured my attention throughout the whole thing and I was able to understand more about the climate crisis. It has inspired me to learn more about it and see how I can make a change in my life that will be for the better of the planet.

The documentary Before the Flood follows Leonardo Dicaprio as he goes to various locations around the world that have been impacted by climate change. It was interesting to see the impacts of climate change with our own eyes in different places of the world because often times it's difficult to wrap one's head around the disasters that are happening and can only understand the ones that are impacting us directly. It’s difficult to grasp how the effects of climate change are impacting people around the world and that’s why I believe the documentary did a good job of showcasing this. Throughout the documentary, various locations were explored- one of them was in Florida. In Miami Beach, Florida, the city floods regularly and homes face a real danger of having their city being wiped off the map if something is not done in response to climate change. The mayor of the city has taken initiative while the federal and state government continue to deny the reality of climate change. Leadership at the local level and involvement of the general public is necessary in order to get state and federal leaders to do the same. 
                  <br><br>
Another crucial interaction that Dicaprio had was in India, where when he discussed solar and wind energy being the only changes that were necessary, he was quickly shut down. In developing countries, it will be difficult to continue their development when the energy sources that are seen as better for the planet are costly. It is also extremely hypocritical of nations such as the United States to tell other nations to avoid using fossil fuels as an energy source when the United States has not made a transition to clean energy either. The United States still heavily relies on fossil fuel energy sources because they are cheaper and because the fossil fuel industry has such a heavy influence on the government and its policymaking. 
                  <br><br>
Having lived in California, I’ve experienced my fair share of earthquakes, fires, and droughts, however, it is terrifying to see the impacts of climate change in other parts of the world. For example, they showed a place in India where the amount of rainfall that fell in a couple of hours resulted in the destruction of crops. The lack of food will inevitably lead to more climate change refugees, and as was noted in Syria, a civil war when the government does not help its citizens. Ultimately, the impacts of climate change will impact the most vulnerable-poor communities who have contributed the least to the pollution of the atmosphere.

14 years ago, Al Gore produced An Inconvenient Truth. The documentary led the public to focus on the field of climate change, but brought many critics to Al Gore as well. Some celebrities did not believe the climate change was a serious issue. 10 years later, An  Inconvenient Sequel was released. Many predictions and worries in the past became the reality. Al gore utilized statistics to show that the extremely hot days had become more numerous than the cooler-average days in our planet. I really respect Al gore because he is a person who really concerns about our planet and takes actions as a pioneer. Teaching common citizens about our current condition is an important way to win support for further protecting plans. It is clear that Al gore realized such idea so he launched many training programs in different countries. Various regions around the world are in an abyss of misery: flood, storms, and other natural disasters caused by climate change destroy people’s houses and make them homeless. The smog in China stirs at my heartstring most since I experienced that period before. During that time, I was in middle school. The school was cancelled for several days because of the heavy smog. I still remembered the horrible smell of air, and it made me fell suffocate. I do not want to return to the past. On the way to save our planet, we still have a long journey to travel. Strong powers, just as Al gore pointed out(such as Donald Trump), may hinder us from going forward, but we should not stop.

An Inconvenient Sequel:
                  <br><br>

“An Inconvenient Sequel” was made in the year of 2017, which is a year after the Paris Agreement was made. We follow the former Vice President of the United States of America, Al Gore, on his journey of fighting for attention and encouraging action nationwide and globally on the crisis of climate change. 
                  <br><br>

In my point of view, Gore is similar to DiCaprio, both determined to find solutions for climate change. But on the other hand, Gore is also very different.  As the former Vice President of the US, Gore visited different countries and have meetings with higher authorities in those countries, he has more political power and also spend more time working on the issues of climate change than DiCaprio. And as we can see from the documentary, it is hard for us to deny Gore’s contributions on the Paris Agreement. Even though Al Gore is not a scientist, he sure is an expert on the issue.
                  <br><br>

As for the 2016 Paris Agreement, we are far off the path we’ve been agreed to. In order to prevent serious consequences, scientists are alarming changes to be made immediately, and there’s a long road in front of us.

I do agree with your opinion that Al Gore, the former Vice President of the United States of America, brought the attention of people from the world toward the climate crisis. "An Inconvenient Sequel" is an amazing film that teaches the audience a lesson. From a scientific perspective, data is the key for the result. This film provides many interviews with different people in different territories. They shared their personal experiences via the camera with the fellows like us. Even though we might not be affected by the changing climate at this point, people in another city might. A human's lifespan is only a few decades, but they have seen a significant alteration of their home, because of climate changes (due to human activities). 
                  <br><br>

The situation that we are facing right now is detrimental, but as you said "there's a long road in front  us." That is 100% correct, both precise and accurate. There is a distant way we need to work as a team to fight. We need more influential people to stand up and bring more citizens from the earth to join the team. Yes, we do need to advance our technology to discover outer space, but at the same time we need to spend more time and money on our only home - the earth.
<br><hr>

After watching both films, "An Inconvenient Sequel" and "Before the Flood" I came to a similar conclusion, finding many similarities between Leonardo DiCaprio and Al Gore. However I did notice some differences between the two as they each went on their quest for answers. While DiCaprio states in his film "Before the Flood" that he may be unqualified to be in such a position,  Gore's unwavering sense of self-confidence can be almost overwhelming at times. Yes, Al Gore has experience in office, which does give him credit, but most importantly neither DiCaprio nor Gore have any history in science.  In my opinion DiCaprio does a better job as a narrator and teacher about the Climate Crisis. Not only is DiCaprio credible because of his praise and position in the UN, but also because he doesn't carry with him the social baggage of having a controversial political history.

                  <br><br>

As for the Paris agreement, I completely agree. In order to move toward a better future for the nation, and for the world, the United States needs to re-join the Paris Agreement as soon as possible. In Al Gore's film "An Inconvenient Sequel" he reiterates that the US is a global leader, and if this is true, then it is absolutely paramount that we rejoin the agreement, and become even more progressive in moving toward complete sustainability.

<br><hr>


I agree that Gore and DiCaprio share some similarities. Both use their positions (Gore being a politician and DiCaprio being a celebrity) to effectively spread their ideas and fears of climate change to a wide audience since they are well known. Furthermore, while both are criticized for their lack of a scientific background, they interview scientists and do extensive research to be well informed on climate science. 
                  <br><br>

With this lack of a scientific background, they are able to find ways to reach the audience in different ways. DiCaprio’s use of Hieronymous Bosch’s “The Garden of Earthly Delights” painting was very interesting. It provided a metaphor to compare the earth to so that people do not need to understand the science of climate change to grasp the effects of it. Furthermore, not being science-based invoked a more emotional response for me to see how we are destroying our own personal garden of earthly delights through our actions. Similarly, Al Gore uses his public speaking skills and charismatic deposition to reach the audience. In “An Inconvenient Sequel”, Gore has a training program to teach others how to capture the attention of large audiences and spread his skills. He is able to travel across the world to give talks and speak with leaders of other nations, like India, and he still tells audiences to not let fear destroy all hope. Many of his talks even have some humorous parts, despite the fact that he also includes parts talking about the destruction from recent hurricanes and the mass deaths from heat waves.
                  <br><br>

They also connect their own experiences in their professions to the theme of climate change. In "An Inconvenient Sequel", Gore talks about how when he was Vice President, he had the picture of Earth on his wall in the White House and he pushed for NASA to create a satellite that could get more images and detect climate disasters, but once President Bush was elected plans for this were changed. In "Before the Flood", DiCaprio mentions that his film, "The Revenant" had to completely change the location that they were filming in to find more snow because there was no longer enough snow in Canada. Thus, Gore highlights the political issues surrounding climate activism and DiCaprio highlights the actual effects of climate change, both from a firsthand perspective.

Though celebrities are famous from their talent and may leave it at that, it is always admirable to see them use their notorious status to inspire their followers and use their influence to voice concerns about important topics and issues. This is what I see here with Leonardo DiCaprio in “Before the Flood.” The fact that he is also a credible individual who has a long history and takes active steps to mitigate the effects of climate change until it is eliminated gives all the more reason to watch this film to get genuinely educated. Even after he is named UN Messenger of Peace on Climate Change, he claims that he is no expert and even points out he needs to learn more, even including clips of those ridiculing him instead of painting himself as a perfect figure. Granted, a viewer like me also had the same wonders of a Hollywood actor leading this movie once beginning to watch, but I was nowhere as harsh as some of those reporters who even claim global warming to be a hoax or make believe. And in addition to this, as I mentioned earlier, I learned much more on how consistent DiCaprio has been as an environmentalist activist. In a way, this movie allows the audience to walk hand-in-hand with DiCaprio because as the movie proceeds, he voices his past ignorance and his curiosity, matching the perspective of viewers.
                  <br><br>

The documentary included notable segments such as clips of scientists and politicians which provided perspective and opinions from different backgrounds and horrifying reveals. An example of this latter is the fact that most of our economy is reliant on fossil fuels -- coals, oil, and natural gas. Oil powers most of transportation sector while coal and natural gas power most of electricity. In this century, we maintain our dependence by methods, such as mountain top removal for coal, fracking for natural gas, offshore drilling for oil, and tar sands (most devastating form of producing fossil fuels, taking away massive forests and requiring a huge amount of energy while devastating wildlife and inhabitants of these areas). In addition to this, almost everything we do releases CO2. Not only are we continuing to contaminate our atmosphere with fossil fuels, but we even ruin our earth physically as a result of this. My eyes were opened that those who deny climate change may not be disbelievers, but actually want to continue to reap the benefits of what fossil fuels bring into their lives. It brings them convenience, wealth, and they will endure warnings as long as it does not affect them immediately.
                  <br><br>

Despite sad revelations, I feel this documentary balances a display of information, a sense of hope, and a call to action. It gave facts and it showed the possibility of growing in education over the topic and provided exposure for ideas, such as a carbon tax from Elon Musk’s logic.

I thought the movie did a great job of showing Leonardo DiCaprio's journey of learning about climate change. I find the The Garden of Earthly Delights painting introduction and ending fascinating. Especially how DiCaprio connects the painting to the climate change problems at the end! I think he mentions human’s greed , which is the cause of climate change. DiCaprio shows us his journeys to Beijing, China, where fossil fuels industries polluted the cities' air. To India, where 300 millions people don’t have access to electricity. To the small islands that feel direct effects of climate change. 
                  <br><br>
It connects to Friday's lecture, where professor Hiltner states that wealthy countries consume the most, but it is  the poors who face the detrimental effects of climate change. It really gets me to think how climate change is not just a population problem, but also the consumption, like the depletion of very out last tropical forests for cheap palm oil. And it also makes me take a step back to evaluate my consumption, with things like power, clothing, eating beef,...etc

Before the Flood:

 </span></div><hr>

<p>
Knowing Leonardo DiCaprio as a climate change activist beforehand, I was curious to see the contents he would discuss in “Before the Flood,” and I ended the film with a greater desire to take action myself. Through his travel to different locations all over the globe and discussions with people of great influence and intellect, I developed a better understanding of not only the cause of global warming but also the consequences that are affecting places today and for the future. The documentary helped visualize the cases presented in the article I read prior to this to physically see the direct impact occurring, such as the deforestation of rain forests and melting ice caps. The two initial moments that stood out to me were the 30-feet long hose that was placed into the ice floor was now completely on the surface after 5 years and Florida’s implementation of pumps into the city to combat rising sea levels. The fact that the mayor had acknowledged that it would only spare them 40-50 years demonstrated the absolute urgency to reduce the effects of climate change instead of simply adapting each time, before it won’t even be possible any longer. However, the most outspoken moment in the film to me was when Dr. Sunita Narain prominently directed the blame towards the U.S., asking us to put our money where our mouth was, since our country is the largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions and having a greater emission per person in comparison to those of other countries. Her presentation of the crop fields that had been flooded by intense and unexpected rainfall reflected the hardships of the native people who labored arduously to grow their crops only to fall victim to consequences of climate change. The greatest challenge to such action seems to lie within our own politicians as they may be corruptly dissuaded by oil corporations to disregard climate change and in turn reject critical policies from being implemented to truly make a difference. At the end of the day, the power truly lies within the public and consumers, but without breaking out of habits and not only realizing the truth but also taking action in response to it, we won’t be able to solve this crisis. Although this disheartens me, I hope to make a difference myself in some way, sooner than later.

I searched this documentary "Before The Flood" on Youtube and i am glad i watched it freely and i even took two afternoons to watch this film more detailedly again. Global Warming has been a serious global environmental issue for the past decades because of the fast development of industries all around the world. And the saddest thing is most people saying it's none of their business. Really? Did they really "take zero participations in damaging our earth"? The answer is no. I've watched this film and it's real tough thing happened in Miami, Florida, sea-level rise greatly. Imagine this beautiful city will be taken place by dirty water popping out from underground. This beautiful green place will disappear if we continue to damage our environment and without  raising awareness of protecting it.

<p>
Honestly, at the start of Before the flood when Dicaprio appears on screen, I laughed a little bit. When I first watched the film, I was unaware that he was the UN messenger of peace on climate change.I had never heard of him doing anything in the realm of the climate crisis. Yet, if someone who captured the hearts and attention of millions of fans throughout his career can do it again to put climate change on the front page, then I let him try. Having him travel across the world to gain information on how the world is changing and people's response, really highlighted the issues of the United States. When he was in india, he was reprimanded on behalf of the united states for telling poorer countries to do better without putting in the work themselves. This embodies the lack of initiative in much of the developed world. The worst part is, it is not US that will feel the effects of climate change first, even though they are consuming the most resources. This film also highlighted the power of big money, and the reality that oil industries are milking what they have with abandon, and it will take so much effort to change that. At the end of this film, I honestly felt exhausted. The cooperation needed to make real changes plus the resistance from industries that pay no regard to their effect on the environment coupled with everyone pointing at the united states as a hypocritical energy consumer that needs to be at the forefront of changes, makes the solutions seem improbable. At the end, these films always end with hope, which as good as that seems, almost erases all of the horror of the rest of the film. It gives people slack, telling them that it'll be okay. This issue crosses political and religious and physical barriers, and that's how it needs to be addressed. But its’ not. Even with the Pope releasing his historical statement, how many hearts did it move? I was just left with the question of what will it take to shake the conscious of the world enough for people to realize that big changes need to happen. That even though it may seem overwhelming, that doesn't mean one should do nothing. If anything, it means we all have to do more. 
                  <br><br>


There are some people that don't believe in climate change, but there are more that do, yet aren't willing to do anything about it. It’s almost like it is so overwhelming that people feel like they have no power individually. And that might be true, it also might be easier to ignore the facts of what is going to happen in our lifetime. But, I think this film also showed the importance of collective action, and also how hard it’s going to be. Four years since this film came out, and we haven't really done much of anything. Hopefully in the next four years, we’ll have something to show for it.

"Before the Flood" was an incredibly provoking film. Not only in the facts it showed, but also the incredible amount of ignorance and backlash that is being thrown at those seeking solutions. From the destruction of forests in Indonesia to the devastation of Canadian forests to flooding in Miami on sunny days, it is so clear that there is already a massive amount of damage being felt from climate change. In a few decades, whole island civilizations may drown due to rising sea levels caused DIRECTLY by anthropogenic climate change. And yet, people in political positions of authority continue to deny and fight against claims of the planet suffering. The fact that the Florida government banned the use of the term "climate change" is infuriating. Scientists and activists have made such strides in spreading their message and they are continuously hindered by the government and media outlets such as Fox News. 
                  <br><br>

Viewing this film in 2020 clouds some of the scientists' optimism. Since the 2016 release of the film, President Trump has removed the US from the Paris Climate Agreement and the effects of climate change continue to create damage. Personal changes to one's lifestyle are important, but the biggest hurdle seems to be convincing politicians and media that the cause of restricting climate change is important and vital if we wish to continue living on Earth. If voters can be convinced of the pure facts of climate change, perhaps we can elect leaders who will join the crusade to heal and save the planet.

I admire Al Gore after watching "An Inconvenient Sequel." His passion for the issue of climate change and his persistence in trying to solve it are shown very well. I was particularly interested by the negotiations with India that end up playing a large roll in the movie. The discussion between Gore and the Minister of State for Environment of India showcase an important attitude from the perspective of developing countries that would resist America's privilege in this shift from fossil fuels. It is understandable that other countries would respond like this because the U.S. is now a super power but we got here through the use of fossil fuels. In developing countries it is harder for leaders to ignore the benefit of cheap energy and reasonable for them to feel like it is their turn to use resources in the same way developed countries have been. This interaction highlights the important topics of responsibility and privilege when navigating the climate crisis. The most powerful developed countries have benefited so heavily from the use of fossil fuels and Al Gore seems to be understanding of India's expectations, and issues with the climate agreement and he works to resolve them. Seeing this issue unfold to a solution of a loan for renewable energy and India's ultimate agreement at the Paris conference was really cool. Overall, I found it interesting to see some of the negotiations that made the Paris Climate Agreement possible. 
                  <br><br>

The other part of the movie that resonated with me the most is Al Gore's trip to Georgetown, Texas, and his conversation with the mayor. The mayor presents himself as a conservative republican but he is also leading one of the most conservative parts of Texas to being 100% renewable. He says "money talks," when explaining the cost benefits of renewable energy. This is a great reminder of how many ways there are to make people care about the issue of climate change. He also says that we "have a moral and ethical obligation to leave the planet better than we found it." Al Gore responds jokingly that he should be careful saying things like that (because many would recognize something like that as a liberal statement). It is so weird that the issue of climate change has become a partisan issue. I would like to understand more about why it is beyond the issue of money for conservatives. It is a human issue and his statement seems so intuitive, yet somehow may not fit the typical speech of a conservative mayor of Texas. Overall I enjoyed this movie and it has influenced me to pay more attention to Al Gore and his work.

I absolutely agree with all the statements you have made. I thought that this film did a wonderful job of presenting the negotiations made between Al Gore and India and highlighted the importance of working together and allowing the underdeveloped countries to work towards development in a renewable and green way. I completely understand how a country like India would argue for fossil fuels since they have seen developed countries like America benefit from them from the last 150 years, but I am glad they see the grave threat it imposes on the world and are willing to reach development through new technological advances. I found the part of the film that showed the Minister of State for Environment agreeing to the Paris Agreement particularly inspiring because you could see and feel the excitement of all the leaders knowing they reached an agreement that supported efforts to stop climate change. I believe that people bond over struggles like this film emphasizes and this scene in the film shows world leaders bonding over global efforts to prevent further climate change in order to make the world a better place for future generations. 
                  <br><br>

I also enjoyed the part of the film that showed Al Gore visiting Georgetown, Texas. In the early political stages of climate change, it was a partisan issue, agreed upon by all parties on its importance and effects. After reading "Merchants of Doubt" in ES 106 I learned how this issue became a bipartisan one through big corporations, mainly fossil fuel companies, using their money and political power to ensure their success. I liked to see that not all conservatives supported these companies and their interests and instead wanted to do what was best for their people and the environment in which they live in. 
                  <br><br>

I also would say that this movie has influenced me to pay closer attention to Al Gore and his interests in climate change. After watching this movie I actually googled Al Gore and looked more closely into him and his climate efforts through the last couple decades. I will continue to see what he supports and what he believes are the best means of fighting climate change.
<br><hr>
I agree that it is absurd that climate change has become such a politicized issue. I often get frustrated listening or reading about people in power (such as the president) who do not believe in climate change. While there are steps that "ordinary" people can make to reduce their environmental footprint, the majority of change has to come from policies made by people in power. I also admire Al Gore after watching this film, as he is using his knowledge of politics and his power as a "recovering politician" to make a difference. I don't think that wanting to solve climate change should be partisan, it is an issue of human survival and well-being, which is something we should all be able to agree on regardless of party lines.

While watching Before the Flood, I was constantly learning new information. Even if some of the information had seemed familiar, the movie allowed us to dive into specifics and how climate change is affecting various areas around the world.
                    <br><br>
  Despite watching a lot of roles Leonardo DiCaprio played on the big screen, I was not aware of his role in the fight for saving the planet. I didn’t know he was appointed the United Nations Messenger of Peace on Climate Change. Going into this film I knew that most of our economy is based on fossil fuels, I even knew some of the dangerous methods that we try to obtain these fossil fuels such as mountain top removal for coal, fracking for natural gas, and offshore drilling for oil. However, I had never heard of the term “tar sands” before, let alone know that tar sands are also used for producing fossil fuels. I really found the scene in lower Greenland powerful. When they said the ice melted 30 feet in 5 years, we all know that’s a grand distance for the amount of time, but having them show the hose and show the audience what 30 feet really looks like, it truly makes the statement that much more powerful. The fact that officials in Florida were banned from using the words “climate change” starting from 2011 after Rick Scott came into office, it just truly demonstrates how ignorant people can be. It’s one thing for a person to not believe in climate change, but for them to create a policy that forbids it to even be discussed further is quite extreme. It’s outrageous how little we care about the health conditions in China that are caused by westernized civilians. After all it’s these westernized countries such as the US that are having China produce products for them and then dumping the waste of those products in China. We’re treating China as if it’s a landfill, not a nation. 
                     <br><br>
 During the film, Leonardo DiCaprio said “China is still heavily relying on fossil fuels, but they seem to be transitioning to renewables much faster than anyone anticipated. The question is, can less developed countries with rapidly growing populations make the same transition?” Honestly, I didn’t like when this was said, it reminded me of a lecture when Ken mentioned that we blame developing countries for the environmental problems we have without realizing how much our actions factor into it as well. Soon after these thoughts were voiced when it was mentioned that the US hasn’t gone solar yet keeps pushing developing countries to go solar. This wasn’t just hypocritical, but very ignorant because solar technology is expensive, developing countries can’t just poof up solar technology because they want to, like everything else in this world, it costs money. I knew the US was problematic in this fight towards change, but the fact that one person in the US has the same consumption as 61 people who live in Nigeria is just insane. In a part of India, we saw how half the year’s rainfall occurred in just 5 hours, I didn’t even know it was possible for something like this to happen. It’s important to realize that a good amount of the US’ contribution comes from beef. After all, 47% of our land is used for food production, however 70% of this is used to feed cattle while only 1% of this is used for fruits, vegetables, and nuts. I knew that cows contribute to methane in the atmoshpere and that it was more impactful than carbon dioxide, but I didn’t know 1 methane molecule was equivalent to a whopping 23 molecules of carbon dioxide. The fact that about 12% of the total US emissions is due to beef makes me hopeful for change because something as simple as cutting beef out of people’s diets can make a huge impact. It’s not like everyone has to go vegetarian or vegan, although that would help even more, but even just switching beef to chicken can make a huge difference. 
                    <br><br>
  President Obama had brought to my attention an issue I never thought of when it came to climate change, and that is national security. A large portion of the world’s population lives near the oceans, if they start moving, we can start to see scarce resources and one of those being land. This film taught me a lot, however I’m still confused about the concept that Europe would get colder due to climate change. If anyone can explain this to me, it would be very much appreciated.

<p>
In the film Before the Flood, Leonardo swiftly lays out the climate crisis in an hour and a half. This was not an easy task to accomplish but I think he did it pretty well! I liked how Ken unpacked these films in this video. The best part of Before the Flood is the very end, where he sums everything up and pushes leaders to make change. This part is very emotional and moving.

I think the film “Before the Flood” was great as far as introducing the topic of climate change. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays himself as a concerned citizen. I felt that helped the common viewer and the public relate to the issue more effectively. I again, think this film was intended to address the common person. Having a popular actor focus on something that isn’t so much in his field of expertise may make the viewer feel more inclined to take a stand on the issue at hand as well. DiCaprio is already a stellar figure to the American people and people around the world so for someone who is widely known and respected as an actor to take a stance on something like climate change is a huge thing. The film actually showed you climate change as it was happening. For instance, seeing how much of the arctic ice has already vanished makes you feel the urgency of the problem. Going back to DiCaprio, I particularly enjoyed how he incorporated his weaknesses and the negatives of how media portrays him as United Nations Messenger of Peace. The action of employing ethos through negative self exposure actually increased his credibility to his viewers. The film was well made and I was not only into it but I came out of it a more concerned citizen for our future. The mentions of fossil fuel companies like Exxon and Shell and their relationship with the government was crucial. Overall the film was put together well, and the issues brought to light were portrayed as urgent and huge. I would recommend this to a friend without question. It is not an extremely long film, it is easy to follow, it is informative, and it includes a well known person known to entertain people. 
                    <br><br>

I left the movie feeling pessimistic about our current situation but optimistic for our future. Leonardo very much instilled the idea, to his viewers, of "what is" to "what could be."

Before the Flood:
                    <br><br>

“Before the Flood” is a film talks about the climate crisis which human are facing right now, and it is featured by Leonardo DiCaprio. In the film, Leonardo DiCaprio traveled to many places around the world, and wanted to find out the truth of global warming, and witness many consequences of people’s pollutions. This film introduces plenty of severe changes that take place all around the world which are triggered by global warming, and many ways not only for the individuals but also for the community as a whole to do to protect the Earth.
                    <br><br>

At the beginning of the film, there is a painting called “The Garden of Earthly Delights” shown to the viewers, and it can be divided into three panels. This painting impressed me because just like Leonardo explained, it can be considered as a process of the birth of humankind and the extinction of humankind if we don’t care about the environment and our planet. For the first panel, Adam and Eve which symbolized the people lived happily on a paradise-like place along with other species. However, as time flies by, the human population grows rapidly, the resourced are almost used up, and the environment is damaged. For the last panel, the place in which people live become chaos, and people there are all suffered from pain. In my opinion, people in the world are experiencing the second panel of the painting right now. We don’t care about what negative influences we bring to the Earth, and damage the planet carelessly. If people don’t stop these kinds of actions, our future will become just like the last panel—hopeless and decayed.
                    <br><br>
Also, in the film, the research professor of Bard College Gidon Eshel mentioned a very interesting idea. He said that one of the most crucial reasons for many tropical deforestation is beef. For America, there are plenty of lands which are used for feeding cattle, this wasted plenty of resources. Moreover, cows produce plenty of methane, which contributed a lot to global warming through the process of the greenhouse effect. Therefore, by simply switch the habit of our diet and lower our demand for beef, we can protect our Earth.

I believe that mentioning the painting, “The Garden of Earthly Delights”, was important as it was the symbol throughout the documentary to mimic what is happening in our world today. With the first panel, I see it as what the world was designed to be like, without all of human pollution and how great it would be without it; being able to appreciate what this world has to offer, rather than taking its resources for granted. I agree with your point that our world today seems to lay within the second panel. Our world seems to consist of many people worried about their own lives when in reality the real issue is what impacts the earth as a whole. As we use more resources we produce more carbon in our atmosphere ultimately causing us to fall within the final panel. Which again, I agree is where this world will come to if we continue what we are doing. The aforementioned regarding the change in diet is also another point with which I agree. Because beef production has a major role in the deforestation, production of methane, and other greenhouse gases, a great first step is to cut out the beef portion of our diets to ultimately create a greater change. I agree with what you mentioned, thank you so much for the review!

<br><hr>
I agree with you that in reference to the painting, “The Garden of Earthly Delights,” that we are currently living in the second panel, but I believe only some of us are. To be more specific, I think that the developed countries are living in the second panel, while some developing countries are in the third panel, if not the third panel, then some sort of stage between the second and third panel. As we saw in the film, some of these developing countries are already receiving the hard consequences of climate change, some of these changes destroying the country itself, specifically the island countries. In India for instance we see their food supply being threatened with their crops being overflooded. In addition, I believe the US climate change deniers such as some politicians and citizens believe we are all living in the first panel, and don’t recognize the trouble that’s yet to come, let alone the trouble we are already in.

“Before the Flood” is a kind of movie that is made to present serious environmental problems. In the movie, it is impressed that Greenland ice sheet had been melt to a greant extent due to global warming. Just within five hundred years, hundreds of cubic kilometer of ice had already become water. Moreover, it the global warming remains, it is going to disappear. The content of the movie strives to find out ways to alleviate the problem of global warming, including how to prevent the rising sea level, investigating renewable energy, and immigration. It raise people’s awareness of the current environmental problem and appeal to people to environmental protection.

I agree with you on your comment. The documentary "Before the Flood" illustrates the environmental problems that are occurring all around the world. Along, with showing the problems people have created for the environment the Documentary also touches upon alternative ways to reduce the impact we created as society on Earth. The part I really liked in this documentary is when DiCaprio interview Elon Musk about what he was doing at Tesla, and how batteries will help reduce our impact on the environment. I was wondering if you had a particular part of the film that you found most interesting?

The sheer impact of Gore's first documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth," is undeniable, but I feel as though his follow-up of "An Inconvenient Sequel" fell short of making as good of a mark upon me. Throughout the film, it follows Al Gore traveling throughout the world in an effort to educate and train people on climate change. In my opinion, Gore's specialty is his ability to present data and notions that connect with the audience and create a lasting impact upon them. This is seen frequent times, especially during his presentation of information in front of a screen and audience. One prime example was his emotional outburst regarding the spread of Zika virus and the complacency that puts humanity at risk as more of these threats are brought to fruition by anthropogenic climate change. Often times, data and numbers in the written word are glossed over due to the nature of the format. You can't stop someone from ignoring an aspect or skimming over an article. However, it is much harder to ignore speeches and presentations, like Al Gore in his film, because his voice carries and his emotions can rally change more than other formats can in some ways. In these ways, the film was an enjoyable watch, but I had a hard time interpreting the film's tone and some of Gore's efforts seemed futile at this point, nearly three years after. Much of the film was optimistic as Gore and his influence allowed for the making of change, but there were several interjections of political aspects and quotes regarding the view of climate change by the current government that undermined that feeling of optimism. So while the film attempted a call to action, it felt as though reality came crashing down almost immediately after.

Before the Flood is a powerful movie following Leonardo Dicaprio on his search for the truth about climate change. I learned a lot from this movie and I can’t say I initially thought I would when I saw that it was going to follow him. I appreciated the range of perspectives that the film took the time to showcase, travelling around the world to get the perspectives of so many different countries allowed the audience to get a more complete education on climate change. However, while saying this, I would have appreciated more of the perspectives from scientists as we touched a lot on politicians - the movies results in Dicaprio presenting to the UN so while the politicians have valid perspectives in the end goal, the educational aspect here gets a little lost because politicians aren’t necessarily trained experts in climate change. 
                    <br><br>

I was very alarmed by the loss of ice in Greenland, the pipe that had melted out of feet of ice was disturbing, and had happened in the last few years, this is a wake up call. Right now a lot of climate change skeptics are skeptical because they can’t necessarily see or feel the effects of climate change that everyone is screaming about. However, this massive portion of melted ice in Greenland is physical evidence that we need to make changes and we need to make them quickly. 
                    <br><br>

I think the movie is effective in calling attention to the climate crisis for people who dont necessarily believe in climate change because it takes you on an educational journey. You set out to learn more about the climate crisis while you try to learn with one of the most famous actors in the world. I think the use of so many politicians in this aspect is good because a lot of climate change skeptics are against climate change due to politics. Getting politicians perspectives from all around the world, in this aspect is a very effective learning tool. But what I think is also good about looking around the world is that it shows just how inattentive the USA is and how we are creating a majority of these issues and are doing the least to combat them.
                    <br><br>

I think the movie really calls attention to how we are and how we will feel the effects of climate change.

When I began watching “Before the Flood”, I was initially skeptical about the film being produced by Leonardo Dicaprio. I knew that he had experience, and some knowledge in climate science. However, I was wary because I remember in past years he was criticized for demanding change and better practices from countries and their citizens, yet he himself used private jets to travel to many of the climate conferences he spoke at. Before watching the film, I looked into this and found that Dicaprio seems to take commercial flights now. Additionally, Dicaprio seemed to address this issue in the film by acknowledging that his carbon footprint is bigger than the average American, likely due to his jet set lifestyle. In my opinion, this was a positive precedent for the film because I had initially been worried Dicaprio was a celebrity who did not practice what he preached. I am glad the film used Dicaprio, I feel that his previous experience in environmental activism makes him a reputable source, and his fame creates a draw for audiences who may not otherwise watch the documentary.
                    <br><br>
I did not know what to expect going into this film, but I really enjoyed the global perspective filmmakers took, because climate change is entirely a global issue that requires the cooperation of all countries and citizens. Something that immediately struck me was the fact that many members of Congress do not see anthropogenic climate change as a problem, and thus block any bills, such as a carbon tax, from being implemented. What struck me even further, was that many politicians who deny climate change, such as Paul Ryan, are paid millions by the fossil fuel industry. This gave me little hope, because I feel that the United States government will never be able to make sweeping changes to aid in the climate crisis. The film mentioned that in countries such as China, where entire cities are blanketed in a thick, unescapable smog, citizens demanded change, and the government responded positively. China now has real-time trackers that allow citizens to see which factories obey new laws, and which do not. This led me to wonder, if citizens of the US were consistently in a thick smog, and climate change were more blatantly obvious, would we respond the same way, and would the government follow? 
                    <br><br>
Another thing that concerned me about the film was the way that other countries view the United States in terms of climate change, which happened to be a very negative light. For example, the climate official from India said that one of her biggest concerns is the United States. Not only does the US government remain stagnant on the issue, but citizens continue to purchase big homes, big cars, and unnecessary products. I used to feel that the government had to make sweeping changes before anything would happen. However, I realized that just by changing my lifestyle I would already be making a small impact.

In my life-time  I had only knew DiCaprio as an actor, so when I saw the film I was also a bit confused as to why he was chosen by the UN to be the Messenger of Peace and speak about climate change, but I realized that I myself was being like the people shown in the film that degraded DiCaprio for not having the credentials. Then I realized that you do not have to be an environmental scientist to speak up about Climate Change, because it is an issue that involves all of humanity because we created it and as many voices we can get to speak up about it the better. With the film I felt like I was also taking the same journey as DiCaprio to learn more about how climate change is affecting different areas and how different countries view the US. I also wonder how the issue would be impacted if the US  tried to become a leader in the climate crisis. I realized that the rest of the world really does look at the US as a major influence for their governments. What if the US made drastic movements to help the climate crisis, then other nations would follow. Although, it seems nearly impossible with our current politicians, and their connections with big fossil fuel companies. From my perspective the only reason the climate crisis is an issue is because of the economics of the world and most importantly the US. If oil and coal  weren't so profitable for these big companies they wouldn't be using it as much. Then again if people were not so dependent on these things we would also see a major change. 
                    <br><br>
Another issue that surprised me was that of the people in poorer nations, they want the life style that we Americans have, so why do anything different if the US isn't. We often blame other nations because of the large population, but if we look at their carbon footprint, 1 Americans carbon footprint is way larger than that of another person from a poorer nation. So we are really a huge part of the problem and as a leading nation we could start a new movement to fix the climate crisis.

Leonardo DiCaprio’s film “Before the Flood” was an eye-opening documentary that showed how ordinary people and places around the world are affected by climate change. While watching the film, I was shocked by the extent to which poor communities around the world suffered from the actions of wealthier first-world nations and the oil industry. It is unfair that developed nations continue to pollute the planet at high rates while nations with much lower carbon footprints suffer for it. Poor communities in India that lose their crops to floods, cities along the Florida coast that are on the verge of sinking, wildlife in Indonesia that lose their homes to deforestation, and northern ice caps that are rapidly melting are examples of the numerous and permanent effects that greenhouse gas emissions will have on our planet. It is frustrating that the U.S. has done little to lower carbon emissions despite being the world’s second largest polluter, and has even taken steps backward that will do more harm. The documentary has shed light on the corruption in our politicians that hinders the U.S. from effectively fighting climate change - many senators and representatives take money from large oil companies, such as those founded by the Koch brothers, and blatantly undermine the effects that climate change has around the globe. Some go as far as to say that climate change isn’t caused by humans at all. The film was demoralizing in a way, because it showed how little the people in power cared about the long-term consequences of their actions, so long as they maintained a life of convenience or were bribed by corporations in the oil industry. Another controversial issue the film discussed was how developing nations such as India are forced to choose between modernizing their country and minimizing their impact on the environment; most of the time, they will not choose the environmentally sustainable options. Figuring out how developing countries can industrialize without damaging the environment is one of the major battles to fight within the overarching climate change problem. The U.S., which already has gone through industrialization, should be setting an example by switching to sustainable energy itself.
                    <br><br>
However, one of the positive changes the film covered was how China - the world’s greatest emitter of carbon - decided to begin the transition to sustainable energy sources rather than oil and gas.

Watching the film “Before the Flood” provided me with a deeper understanding of climate issues I was aware of, and opened my eyes to aspects of global warming that I didn’t know were occuring. In some areas of the film, the perspective given was creative and unique. For example, there was an interesting comparison in the beginning of the film between prior species that have come along and negatively affected the environment or caused other species to become extinct, and humans who are doing these exact things but are different because they are knowingly doing it. It is frustrating to watch because we know that it is going to take a global change in the way we do things to reverse our affects. One thing that frustrates me even further is watching educated people genuinely deny the presence of climate change. It’s hard for me to believe that someone could look at the current facts and still not understand that this is what is happening NOW.
                    <br><br>

A few moments in the film were quite shocking to me. The overhead visuals of the tar sands were impactful because all I could think about was that all of that would still be nature if humans weren’t here, or were smarter about the way we get energy. One fact that surprised me was that 300 million people in India are currently without access to power, roughly 30 percent of the households in India. I wasn’t aware that the percentage of Indian people without power was that high.

I agree with your initial analysis of the movie in the context that, this movie brought the climate crisis into a closer, more personal scope with DiCaprio simply asking the questions for the viewer to these people that have researched and came up with explanations for the issue at hand. The views and visuals that it gave us viewers captured me most impactfully, causing me to look at the issue from a more concerned view than I had prior. This movie was unlike any other documentary I had ever seen in that the perspective, as I had mentioned earlier and Roman did as well, differs from the usual way that documentaries attempt to educate its viewers. The way that some people went to fully deny the massively overarching issue at hand, brings much concern to me when it comes to the future of this issue. Like the movie says, this is becoming a major issue at the polls where people continue to vote in political officers who deny the facts and it is our duty to elect officials that drive change to help preserve the earth that has been deteriorated by us humans, who through science have known the effects of the burning of fossil fuels and continued to be ignorant to the matter at hand.

After watching “Before the Flood” I felt more enlightened about the climate crisis and felt that it achieved a global perspective of the issue. Prior to watching the film, I hadn’t known about Dicaprio’s efforts regarding climate change. I enjoyed his approach and felt that not only the merit but the attitude of his interviewees was diverse. The documentary also unveiled the acts of the fossil fuels companies and their efforts of denial on climate change, which added more depth to the issue on a political level. I feel that the documentary thoroughly covered the scientific, social, political, and emotional aspects of the issue. I not only felt educated but felt called to action and felt I should question my morals and daily life choices. The powerful scenes of the flooding in Florida and the Suncor oil sands paint a real visual of the issue and allow the audience to view this on a tangible level, which I believe is one of the most difficult parts for those who are skeptical. Real, raw, tangible evidence is what skeptics need in order to abandon their denial of the issue and Dicaprio gives the audience just that. By seeing the real effects that resulted from our behavior, a feeling of shame is instilled. By bringing us with him to the singing of the Paris Agreement, Dicaprio allows the audience to feel hope for the future and feel the collaboration across the globe. By not only addressing and conveying the many aspects of global warming, Dicaprio achieves a comprehensive view of the issue.

I agree with you. I was also unaware that Dicaprio had been an environmentalist for so long, and I think he was the perfect choice for this movie. He is so well known, which helps the movie attract viewers, and regards the climate issue with such care, which I personally felt touched by. I agree with Melissa that Dicaprio’s sense of depression and shock when looking at different climate phenomenon resonates with you, making you feel the same way. Additionally, I also agree that the most surprising aspect of this film was showing the effects of fossil fuel interests on the political system. Although I knew that lobbyists had weight on the political process, I was unaware of the true extent of this in the climate issue. I was appalled by the efforts by fossil fuel interests to divide and confuse the public, just to maintain their wealth. Overall, I believe that this movie was extremely effective in conveying scientific and physical evidence of climate change. The movie covered many of the most important topics regarding climate change like consumption, renewable energy, and international cooperation. By having so many different sources of scientists, leaders, and professors from places all over the world like India, Greenland, and Canada, the viewer can comprehend that climate change is a unanimous theory that affects many aspects of society. I would recommend this movie to others.

Before the Flood presented information about the effects of human behavior and sustainable energy very well. With any film, visuals of the condition of the planet foster reflection in people’s own lives. DiCaprio’s discussions with experts establishes credibility for the impact of climate change. 
                    <br><br>

The film highlights humans’ dependence on fossil fuels. Our dependence on fossil fuels don’t only cause greenhouse gases to be released into the atmosphere. We destroy forests, impact ecosystems, and poison bodies of water, to name a few. DiCaprio reveals how fossil fuels directly correlate to the increase in temperature and rising waters. Fossil fuels release carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere, heat melts the ice, and water levels rise. The information about climate change is easily explained throughout the documentary. One topic that surprised me the most was the scale of how much money fossil fuel interests invest in trying to dismiss the impacts of fossil fuels on climate change. The inability to pass any climate change bill solely because interests have paid members of congress is disheartening. Climate change is more of a political issue than a scientific one. There is evidence that proves climate change is occurring, and scientists are exploring solutions, but without the enforcement of new policies, the potential for profits will continue to halt any scientific progress. 
                     <br><br>

DiCaprio leads the journey with the viewers joining him, playing a key role in establishing credibility and emotionally appeals to the audience. DiCaprio, despite his celebrity status that has allowed people to know of him, is also a United Nations representative on climate change. Therefore, people who watch the documentary may be more willing to accept what is stated because he is knowledgeable about climate change. He also expresses that he has a lot to learn, appealing to the audience who may have very little knowledge of the subject, but would like to learn more.

The film, “Before the Flood,” I particularly enjoyed and was intrigued to watch. The film was engaging and informative, bringing concern and attention to the current issue of climate change that most people do not take seriously or may not think deeply about daily. I like how this film takes a different approach to present the issue in a way that is delivered by showing how daily activities have a greater impact on the environment as well as the large role politics plays in climate change, which may be a surprise to many. In the first half of the film, there is a certain part that talks about some simple solutions to help the problem of climate change and one simple problem that can help and stood out to me was the act of simply changing our dietary choices, like eating less beef. I would like to try to implement this into my life by trying to consume less beef in my diet, perhaps starting by replacing beef with chicken and eventually maybe only consuming meat a few times a week rather than every day. I also enjoyed how this film encouragingly invites those watching to participate in urgent change and does not really blame or forcibly urge viewers to make a change. 
                     <br><br>

Although many people think Leonardo DiCaprio may not have been the right choice in this film, I think he was rather a good fit. I think Leonardo’s involvement in this film demonstrates the importance of public figures using their name/platform to initiate and encourage change in the world and highlight important and serious issues.

In response to your comment, I agree that the film's method of demonstrating the true effects of our everyday actions and the power that politics has on climate change was very effective in presenting their message to the audience. The ridiculous amount of people who claim climate change is nothing but a hoax is truly aggravating to me. I'd highly recommend this film to anyone who is unsure of the true aspects of climate change and many of my friends so we could all work on saving our planet! I think my favorite part of the film, to be honest, is the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio is in the film because I, too, believe he was a good fit for the message of how public figures should contribute to initiating and encouraging change for the better of the world.

Watching the documentary “Before the Flood” was a highly informative yet extremely daunting cinematic experience. Leonardo DiCaprio took viewers along his journey as an environmental activist, specifically regarding climate change, traveling the world in an attempt to gain a greater understanding of the crisis and the grim future will that be inevitable with a course of inaction. While watching the film, I found myself to be extremely impressed with DiCaprio’s extended knowledge and dedication to climate justice. I was also appreciative that he made clear what he still does not know, then embarking on a journey to seek out the information that he needs to tackle the monumentally dire issue. 
                     <br><br>


It is one thing to hear about the predictions of the effect of climate change, but it is entirely different to witness the real changes that already span the globe. In the United States, it is far too easy to be ambivalent or in denial of such an issue as the effects of climate change have not reached the country in a clearly notable way. The countries that are facing the devastating effects of climate change are often among the poorest and in turn, those who contribute the least carbon emissions. It was painful to watch clips of island communities that have been decimated as a result of rising sea levels, especially with the knowledge that a majority of CO2 emissions have come from the United States.

I was also appalled when the film “Before the Flood” started focusing on the United States role in climate change. It has contributed a lot in causing this crisis yet those who live here are the ones more safely insulated from the consequences of climate change and like you said can live in denial of what’s clearly happening. It seems particularly cruel to me that the ones who benefit and profit the most of the exploitation of the Earth’s resources are the ones with enough money to not be affected a lot by climate change. 
                     <br><br>

The scene with Sunita Narain talking with DiCaprio is especially provoking to me. As an American I never really thought of how much I am contributing in comparison to other people around the world and really made me think about privilege. Despite being one of the powerful countries in the world, the United States continues to rely on fossil fuels instead of changing direction toward cleaner alternatives. Like the representative said the US could be a leader, but we’re only exacerbating the situation.



 </span></div><hr>

<p>
Both films look at what other countries, particularly India, could be doing. Both show reasons why India is still using fossil fuels and why the US should provide aid. Both focus on energy sources from a scientific and economic perspective. Both focus on humanitarian impacts, such as displacement, injuries, and deaths from natural disasters exacerbated by humans. I appreciate that Di Caprio shows how America is at fault by taking the stance of an American investigating the issue. Through his interview with The Director of India’s Centre for Science and Environment, we learn that one American consumes 34 times as much energy as an Indian person. He does not directly call America out; he does this through interviews. He shows that China is only polluting that much because they are producing to feed our consumerist culture. Al Gore, however, does not really try to blame America. He only encourages America to be the leader by providing aid. However, He does show how America is at fault through the Indian person’s perspective: we’ve been using fossil fuels for 150 years to develop our economy, but India doesn’t get the same chance to develop its economy.  

                     <br><br>

There was a scene in Gore’s film where representatives of other countries say that they can’t deal with the issue of India’s economic barriers to switching to renewables that made me think of a group project where everyone just waits on each other because no one really wants to do anything. The US blames India for not switching to renewables; India doesn’t have enough support, and other countries can’t solve the interest issue. However, I think this is less India’s fault. I believe if America really wants a change, it should start with itself. In retrospect, this might’ve been the reaction Gore was trying to elicit. I was wondering why Gore and Di Caprio would focus on other countries. It might be to respond to the audience that believe that other countries are more at fault because we have renewables but they are still using fossil fuels. They provide information through India’s perspective on “this is why they can’t switch, this is how the US can help them switch, and this is how much we have contributed to the problem in comparison to them”. Moreover, exposing all the inaction and stalling by our leaders may compel the viewer to action. He has shown that the Kyoto Protocol was useless, and emphasized how frustrating COP21 was because 1. It took so long to get there, 2. There are no enforcements, and 3.  It is still not aggressive enough. The viewer gets the sense that they cannot wait on foreign policies or their leaders, such as the mayor in Florida that spent an unnecessary amount of money to pump out the ocean to combat sea level rise. The people themselves must take action by voting, getting their schools, city, state, etc to become carbon neutral, as stated at the end of the film.

In the film, “ An Inconvenient Sequel”, Al Gore emphasizes how the glaciers are melting leads to negative effects like the flooding that happens in Florida. It is traumatizing to see how the glaciers are melting really fast in a short period of time. Since the glaciers are melting really fast, there is a constant climate crisis in different areas. Al Gore informs how the scientists are attempting to at least to protect a distinguished foot per year. It brings me to tears to see the effect of the floods in Florida and how there are many people at risk. When I saw the people traumatized over what happened, I felt like I wanted to be more knowledgeable and make quick solutions. I want to depreciate the climate crisis and how to make the world a safer place to live in. Al Gore explains  how India builds new plants which will help cover what was reduced.
                     <br><br>

In addition, I was engaged when the movie mentioned Pope Francis which states that , “The grave effects of all attacks on the environment are suffered by the poorest.” This is interesting how the people who are less fortunate how to go through the worse scenarios and situations during climate changes which makes it harder for them to survive. It is harder for them to adapt since they don’t have the proper resources as other people do. This opens my eyes to see  how many people lack of  resources or go through harsh situations which can be traumatizing and scary.It is unfair for the poor people for them to go through that trauma, yet they do the minimal and don't deserve to go through those dark events. Al Gore informs possible solutions on how to improve climate change and protect other countries and states from natural disasters. He also emphasizes expanding renewable energy and new coal plants to improve the economy and as a whole. As well, Al Gore explains how in order to fix the climate crisis, we need to fix the government crisis first. I understand where he is coming from, but I believe that if we fix the government it might be too late for the upcoming climate crisis. We might not have the chance to make a difference if the climate change if we focus on government issues. We should have an open mindsets of all issues as a whole.
                     <br><br>

Justin Trudeau explains how climate change has become one of the gravest challenges, and it brought to my attention how now that the “government is making climate change a top priority.” This demonstrates how we can still make a positive impact for the future, but I am frightened since the world is evolving really fast can we still have ability to change it before it is too late. I also was interested in how he wanted to inform the public about the possible solutions and issues due to the climate crisis. Furthermore, I also liked how Al Gore emphasizes how the picture of Earth from space can actually make you feel a connection. I was looking through different pictures and it encourages me how we are all connected and can make a simple difference with our actions.

I really liked your thought about how it might be too late for the government to take action but instead we should take action as a whole. It is really astonishing what human collectivism could do. Together, even without a government, we could not just raise awareness for climate change, but as well as take action. When face against a common enemy, I believe that we, the people, could be the leader of ourselves and make a change for our own good. I also appreciate how you mentioned that the weakest suffer the most from the actions of the powerful. We are no longer living in a primal society in which the strong and suitable survive, we are now civilized people living on one single planet, we should be dependent on each other instead of solely exploiting the weak for our own good.

Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth” was very interesting to me because I really resonated with many of the speeches that he gave (especially the final speech in which he compared the movement to curb climate change to the women’s rights movement and similar movements). Watching this movie, I can see why inspiring environmentalists have to be good orators. In order to mobilize the masses, a person must be confident in their goals and their beliefs in order to instill similar feelings in their audience, and Gore is able to do this quite well. 
                     <br><br>

I thought that the movie gave many good examples of how climate change is affecting our planet, specifically the example of how the Swiss camp was, during one season, level with the ice and, in the next season, much of that ice had melted to expose the metal rods holding up the center. But even offering these obvious examples is not enough to change the minds of climate change disbelievers, such as Florida’s governor, who refuses to meet with any environmentalists (what is ironic is that much of Florida’s population will be affected by climate change since the sea level may/will most likely rise about 7ft very soon).
                     <br><br>

A quote which especially stuck with me was “no other country can play the role the U.S. can play [in the movement to curb climate change]”. I think that America, a developed country with a lot of resources and power, should be doing a lot more to lead the “green” movement than it’s doing right now. One way that we could inspire all people, not only Americans, to become more aware of what they can do to curb climate change is to show them a photograph taken of the Earth from Space by NASA, as Gore suggested by informing the movie watchers that “ when people see Earth from space, they feel a connection to it”. 
                     <br><br>

While America is not stepping up to the plate in this “green movement”, other countries and their leaders are. One such example is Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, who stated that: “...our [Canada’s] government is making climate change a top priority.” Even Pope Francis wants to inform the public of the dire consequences of climate change in stating that: “the gravest effects of all attacks on the environment are suffered by the poorest”, which is a fact that all developed countries and their citizens should especially consider. I am hopeful that the powerhouse that is America will be able to take hold of the "green movement", but first, we as the citizens of America need to stand up for what we believe in: that the Earth and its inhabitants deserve to be saved from complete destruction.

I believe your comment is so spot on and I really like the way that you address so many different issues from the film in such a clear and concise manner. I completely agree with you in regards to your paragraph about the U.S.’s role in the discussion on climate change; I too feel that our nation should be using more of its resources and power towards being a more environmentally friendly country, especially since so many countries look to the U.S. as a blueprint for success. If we truly are a “world superpower”, then we should be doing the most to protect our natural world and everyone who calls it home. 
                     <br><br>

Another aspect of your response that stood out to me was when you stated that “offering these obvious examples is not enough to change the minds of climate change disbelievers” because I think you are completely correct in saying that sometimes facts are not enough to change minds and we should not solely rely on them to make people believe in climate change. Speaking of, I had never really thought long and hard about how climate activists need to be both well informed and well spoken in order to truly relay their message about climate change until you mentioned this in your first paragraph. After reading this and thinking about “An Inconvenient Truth” I think you make a really good point that someone who knows how to communicate and has experience with public speaking (such as Al Gore) is better fit to speak out about climate change than a scientist because people connect more with someone personable and easy to understand. This also reminds me of environmentalist Rachel Carson because she was an extremely talented writer and exceptional communicator who knew how to translate complicated science into layman’s terms, which made her a wildly popular and impactful environmental activist!

<br><hr>
I’m very happy to see that Al Gore made a squeal to his film an inconvenient truth because so much has happened that has made the original film outdated, what I’m thinking of primarily was the climate denier’s response to the green initiatives of the Obama administration which was to create DonorsTrust and break our democracy with big money with the goal of getting people to doubt that climate change is actually a problem. I’m happy to see that Al Gore is still working on getting climate action to be a reality despite these setbacks (and also Trump taking us out of the Paris Climate Accord) while also addressing how cheap and promising solar/renewables are becoming that the oil companies are trying to make people doubt their effectiveness as well. 
                     <br><br>

Another aspect of the film that stuck out to me was the process of the signing of the Paris Climate Accords in the first place, which I had no idea there was a massive terrorist incident just two weeks before, and that India almost didn’t sign the accord and only did because they were able to be guaranteed the credit that they would need to use solar panels to get the 300M Indians without electricity power instead of using dirty coal power plants.
                     <br><br>

As someone who has looked and been continually disappointed at the way this country has been going with Trump revoking US involvement in the Climate Accords, big money corrupting the political system, and big oil fueling a wave of fear (of speaking up) and doubt about the climate crisis, this movie has given me hope that despite all these massive obstacles the push toward saving the planet is still possible.


<br><hr>
I agree with the fact that a developed country as the United States should be doing more in taking action rather than trying to get less developed countries to join as well. The less developed countries do not have the resources or can afford to try to use solar/ wind energy at the moment.  Not just the United States, but any country that has the resources should be leading by example if they truly want change.

The film “Before the Flood” is mainly narrated by Leonardo, who was one of my favorite actors. I believe that a film leading by such a popular, well-known actor might appeals more audience to appreciate this documentary. The film perfectly illustrates the specific climate problem: global warming. Leonardo DiCaprio’s journey over the world, including China, Canada, India, and North Pole, as a United Nations Messenger of Peace, gradually leads the audience to visually understand the whole information about global waring what the director want us to know. 
                     <br><br>


The most unique, impressing parts of the film is the beginning and the end, personally. I was directly driven into the topic by the lead of three different paintings: the beautiful eden garden; before the flood; and the dark, devastating one. The film tells us we are currently living in the world described as the second one, and we still have chance to make our environment, our hometown, better, if we—citizens and governors—take words into actions. Otherwise, we could just turn all the things we cherished into history, just what Leonardo said in the end of the film. 

                     <br><br>

To rate the film, I will probably give it a very high grade, since I was not able to think after the last word of Leonardo, when he is making a speech. It is too powerful and persuasive. In the 90 minutes time, the film do provide tangible solutions to our urgent environmental problems, instead of just talking boring theories. For instance, a scientist points out that the easiest way to make changes is to adjust our diets, because the cows produce so much methane, which is much more serious in hurting environment than carbon dioxide. I would expect more close-related solutions that people could apply, but I recognize that it is already a compact, persuasive documentary rather than a longer, boring one with too much examples or illustrations.

I agree, to a degree, that having a well-known actor or famous person act as a spokesperson for a certain issue can be influential and encourage more support behind the cause, but this can only happen when they are trusted by the majority of the public and are honest about their intentions concerning their involvement. In this case, I think Leonardo DiCaprio was transparent about his place within the climate crisis and why he was traveling and meeting with both professionals in their field and people on the ground being affected by global warming. The power and privilege that comes with money allowed DiCaprio to fly across the world and interview very elite celebrities, professionals, and experts to educate himself, and thus the public through this documentary. 
                     <br><br>


Beginning and ending the documentary with a striking and symbolic piece of art depicted the seriousness of the crisis our planet is facing, and quite frankly has been seeing for quite some time, but never as bad as it has been in the past few decades. Even though the painting itself is centuries old, it is a consequential piece that acts as foreshadowing of how bad our systems can get, including societal, ecological, and global. I think DiCaprio’s inclusion of this personal part of his life and its relation to our current environmental crisis both is meant to be a warning and a call to action. If we know how miserable our world can turn if we continue down the path of destruction, why wouldn’t we want to take preventative measures to divert ourselves from hell on earth?

                     <br><br>

I also agree with you when you mentioned that you appreciate the tangible steps that people can take to do their part and not be as complicit in vastly contributing to global warming and overall climate change. Even if people are either unable or unwilling to change their day-to-day actions to lessen their impact, there are still other ways to make a change, such as using your vote and educating yourself and others to stay informed. This can range from keeping selfish, greedy, ignorant, and arrogant politicians out of power and rallying to protest or advocate for greater, positive change that will lead to more sustainable, equitable, and just societies.

Film: Before the Flood
                     <br><br>

I believe that this documentary film brilliantly depicted the terrifying truth of our planet’s climate change crisis, and I praise Leonardo DiCaprio for using his voice and platform to reach out to a wide spectrum of perspectives and present the issue in an all-rounded manner. It’s really difficult to imagine that any person who has seen the film - and indeed, any person who has experienced the global impact of climate change - will find a counterargument to the vivid facts. It is a shame that those who do not want to embrace the scary image of humans driving their planet out of control refuse to live up to their responsibility, and instead attempt to discredit the speaker who points out the problem. This mindset will perhaps be the reason we have to explain to our children and grandchildren about the disappearing Arctic ice in 2050, when the world will continue to go down an irreversible spiral of erratic catastrophes…
                     <br><br>

I’d like to end this comment on a positive note, following the film’s message: even though humans have been the main cause of accelerated climate change, they will also be able to solve this problem if everyone contributes to a united effort. For our generation, the road ahead won’t be easy to navigate, as we must impose radical changes to compensate for our predecessors, and today’s neoliberalism is already rendering our lives “bare” and seemingly powerless. I think the correct reaction to this film would not be to cry in despair, but rather to stand up and fight back.

I was very surprised to see Leonardo DiCaprio in “Before the flood.” I admire his dedication to alarm us about the climate crisis. The scene that impacted me the most was him visiting the ice fields and showing how they are melting. The details provided in the video really gave me a sense of sadness and fear. Just imagining that eventually Greenland will melt and rise sea level terrified me. Knowing now that coral reefs are being lost and that they are a source of food is also depressing. I can’t imagine the struggle that such an event would cause on people since they would have to search for other forms of food.
                      <br><br>

Subsequently, I have learned that even though there is science as evidence out there, people still do not believe there is a climate crisis. Now I understand why the action to do something is not progressing. Another thing that I learned what we can all do something about it like stop buying products with palm oil or decrease the amount of meat that we eat. This film really does the job at promoting change.

I agree with your assertion that this film was very successful in spreading the idea that we can all take part in mitigating the climate crisis by making small changes in our lifestyles. After watching it, I have made a few promises to myself to alter my lifestyle in small ways.  However, I do not believe eliminating the purchases of products with palm oil is as simple as it sounds. I wish it was. The deforestation taking place for palm oil plantations is not ok.  It is very easy to make the commitment to boycotting products with palm oil at first thought, but with a closer look it becomes evident that palm oil is used in approximately 50 percent of all packages foods as well as in our beauty products, cleaning products, and  biofuel. I think in our consumer driven society, it is not feasible for lots of people to stop purchasing products with palm oil. These products would most likely be more expensive, as lots of environmentally friendly products are, and sadly, many families are not worried enough about our climate to switch to more expensive products.  I think that the deforestation resulting from the palm oil industry is an atrocity and needs to stop, and I wish there was an easier way to avoid these products containing palm oil.

Before I watched the movie I knew that climate change was a serious and progressing thing but after the movie I realized how much more devastating it is. It is sad to see that most Americans aren’t taking it seriously because they don’t see it directly effecting them. People of smaller and less fortunate countries are seeing the effects way more but what they are doing isn’t enough. It is sad to see that there is a lot of politics involved as well because politicians can’t and won’t realize what’s happening. They are in denial. I appreciated how DiCaprio took on this role to show the world what’s happening even though he got hate because he’s “just an actor”. By him doing this it shows that anyone can help and make the world better. I enjoyed the film and thought it was very informative and eye opening.

The documentary "Before the Flood" was very alarming and effective in showing the horrors of climate change. I like how the documentary takes a trip to all different parts of the world to show how climate change is a big issue globally. I knew a bit about climate change before the documentary, but now I am educated on more ways to help the crisis. One of those ways, for example, would be to support the carbon tax. This would make significant difference in how much dangerous greenhouse gases get emitted in the atmosphere. I think the film really made me think about the consequences of global warming and how the planet could all come to an end because companies that profit from greenhouse gas-emitting industries don't want to sacrifice money to save the planet. 

                      <br><br>

On another note, I believe DiCaprio was perfect for this documentary. He has authentic passion and love for the planet that is shown through his actions and efforts to better the planet. Everything about the film gave me that "sense of urgency". Considering that the film intended to invoke that "sense of urgency", I would say that the film was very effective.

I understand where the Republicans are coming from when there was an outburst about having Leonardo DiCaprio head this film, Before the Flood, and the entire movement of environmental remedy since he has no background in any field of science nor experience in the matter. However, I also believe this: anyone can make a change if they truly have the heart to do so. He is also backed by his producer Fisher Stevens who is well versed with the subject. This swings in DiCaprio’s favor since he has had a special place in his heart for the planet since his childhood. I really admire that DiCaprio is making a just use of his power, fame, and money to spread global awareness of this crisis. Rather than sit in a mansion in Los Angeles, he is traveling to India, Canada, Indonesia, the Arctic Circle, Florida, China, and the sinking islands of the South Pacific. I appreciate that he gives these people an outlet that they otherwise would not have. Giving the microphone to people who need to be heard was a great addition to the film.
                      <br><br>
The most moving part of the film was the feature of the Nasa employee, Piers Sellers, who dedicated his entire life to saving the planet. I wish he was still alive to share his wisdom. I also would like to look at the live global map of heat projection that was shown. I believe that if the public had access to a broadcast of this changing, evolving map for non-believers to have proof of the current activity.

As far as making a switch from beef to chicken-I truly had no idea the positive impact that this simply tradeoff could mean for the world. I feel like I could easily contribute to this switch and even encourage my family and friends to do so as well. Chicken is a cheaper alternative at the store too!

As I was watching "Before the Flood" I couldn't get the idea out of my head that this film should be required to watch in every middle or high school. Firstly, Leonardo DiCaprio poses as a well known and admired narrator that the youth of America can look up to and believe in. American culture has such a strong fascination with the people deemed celebrities. People are conditioned to follow fashion trends set by the Kardashians and diets recommended by models, so putting DiCaprio as the face of this film will catch peoples interest, and inspire them to follow in his footsteps. He brings pop culture to the basic facts of climate change, allowing for the message to be heard not just by environmental activists and climate scientists, but by all Americans familiar with his award-winning reputation.
                      <br><br>
Additionally, "Before the Flood" provides an ample amount of basic information about the state of the planet, but also uses examples that are relevant, interesting, and often ignored by the American eye. The struggles of farmers in India, breaking their backs to grow onions only for their fields to be flooded in the course of a day. Hearing about a population the size of the U.S. that does not have access to electricity. Watching a visual representation of the amount of ice that has melted in the Canadian Arctic. These problems are ignored and by many Americans, but "Before the Flood" sheds light on what we can't directly see, and motivates us to amend it.

I agree so much with what you said at the beginning. Having Leonardo DiCaprio as the narrator would have a lot more people paying attention because he is a celebrity; a public figure. And, having children in middle and high school watch these films would be such a great idea, because it is technically their futures that are at stake. The Before the Flood film was very interesting in that it highlighted the problems already present that are caused by climate change. 
                      <br><br>
What impacted the most from the film was the real life events and things that are happening. From the ice melting from 30 feet to almost nothing to India and how 300 million people were without power. These things were unbelievable to see because honestly I feel like we really don’t believe something is happening until we see it. Showing how much ice has melted and how poor people specifically are living in these conditions really shows us that this isn’t fake or a joke, it’s very much real.
                      <br><br>
The addition of politics was great too, politics have so much to do with the problem. A lot of politicians don't believe the climate crisis because they are funded by the corporations that are contributing to the pollution. And the fact that there are certain scientists who say whatever they are told to say to be able to get funded, makes believing the climate is at a crisis very hard for people. This is why politicians don’t believe because 3% of scientists say it's not happening and that gives them a chance to deny. However the film also showed a big amount of politicians who support the climate crisis and want to help out, we aren’t completely lost.
                      <br><br>
The part I found really sad was about the scientist with the stage 4 cancer and how even though he knew he wasn't going to be on the planet for long was doing what he can to try and help while he can. Scientist/ people like this is who we need to be able to do something before we are literally at the point of no return.

Leonardo DiCaprio in the film "Before The Flood' does an extremely well job in using his voice as a celebrity to capture in more people on this important topic. I felt like many interviews and past clips shown in the film like his discussions with past presidents, Pope Francis, and Elon Musk played an important role in the film and couldn't have been done without a big name like Dicaprio. The film really changed my point of view of on much damaged we've already caused our Earth. Specifically, the personal experiences of the citizens of the developing countries really opened my eyes on the fact that just because I don't directly deal with the effects of climate change doesn't mean it isn't happening.The fact that the U.S. is one of the main causes of these problems wasn't news to me but seeing how other people have to deal with it the consequences made me angry. Although we are not the biggest on the globe, we are the second biggest contributer to the problem. How could so many people collectively let a problem get so bad, putting living creatures of all sorts are at risk? 
                      <br><br>
The selfishness of politicians and huge companies to simply act ignorant about the problems or deny they exist for a payoff astonished me. It felt really frustrating watching knowing these people have the biggest influence and choose to further the problem for their own self interest.For example, the Florida senator not believing in climate change while Florida is one of the states that is at the highest risk for rising sea levels. The common theme for the entire film and well in Ken's lectures is America knowingly contributing to the issue. I can personally relate to this as my city's common income comes from the oil industry and almost everyone I know works at or within an oil rig. Seeing that part in the beginning of the film was the only part I really felt split in the middle. Many of the families I know work for the oil industry as it is the only way to provide for their family. This was the case for my family. However, knowing fully the damage this causes really changed my perspective on  big companies and how they take advantage of the public's unawareness. Seeing the damage fully and growing near the causes makes me wonder what the future holds in terms of a comeback.

Watching the movie "Before the Flood" was pretty eye-opening for me in regards to climate change as a global issue. I've heard about the poor environmental conditions in China and India, but actually seeing it was shocking, and learning specific details deepened my sense of urgency about climate change. It's sad to see that the United States is contributing to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions at such an extreme level, and yet, we are doing so little to change our actions. It's even sadder that so many officials in our government don't even believe that climate change is occuring because they are paid off by big businesses. People living in China are physically reminded every day of the degrading environmental conditions because they can't even breathe the air outside safely. Even though the Chinese government is taking drastic actions to try to fix the problem, millions of people are still suffering from the poor air. We need to use a model of prevention rather than making problems and trying to fix them afterwards because we really are permanently destroying the earth.

Film (An Inconvenient Sequel) - I especially enjoyed Al Gore's film "An Inconvenient Sequel" after watching his first film because it was made more recently and addressed some feedback towards "An Inconvenient Truth." The part that stuck out the most to me was when Al Gore was in a meeting in India, discussing how the administration needs to cut back on the country's pollution and other harmful environmental practices. The Indian representative brings up the point that many developing countries do when pressured to switch to greener practices (which are often not the most profitable or the best immediate choice for an economy trying to grow). He argues to Al Gore that India has a right to pollute in order to develop the same way the U.S. already has, and that his immediate concern is with creating more jobs for Indian people, building infrastructure, etc. The unfortunate reality is that it is much easier for developed nations with the resources and money to limit their emissions. It leads to the question of whether it is fair for more developed world powers like the U.S. and bodies like the EU to encourage world-wide environmental measures, without providing the means to do so and an incentive for countries like India to shift their energy away from other important domestic issues. On the flip side however, one could argue that the technology now exists for countries to develop in greener ways, or that the problem of climate change should take precedent over a country's desire for money or power. Personally, after seeing the footage of devastation caused by hurricanes in the Philippines, I was again amazed by how many lives and suffering is at stake while national leaders bargain and argue over how and when they should fight climate change. In the grand scheme of things, the argument being given by the Indian representative of "you had your turn  to pollute, now it's ours," is not convincing.

I watched “Before the Flood” and thought it was an incredibly engaging and informational documentary film. Leonardo DiCaprio, in my opinion, was an excellent main focus for the film, as we are able to follow his journey in conveying the truths of climate change. Prior to this film, I personally had no idea how much of an activist he was. He was just an actor to me, with no ties to the efforts in climate change. However, seeing him meet with governmental officials in the early 2000’s and even recently with Obama showed that this is a serious topic for him--not just a quick buck that he can make by starring in this documentary. 
                      <br><br>


The most pivotal part of the film for me was when he visited India. When DiCaprio sat down with the environmentalist from India, he was faced with the cold hard facts that America is really lagging behind in efforts to save our planet. He attempts to argue that people cannot change their habits, but she quickly fights back and brings up many good arguments. For instance, China, who used to be on the forefront of fossil fuel usage, has even made more strides towards renewable energy than the United States. If China’s population can strike against the government’s excessive use of fossil fuels, then why can’t the citizens of America do the same? The answer was soon unveiled, as watchers saw that fossil fuel leaders, specifically the Boch brothers, bribe their way into our media. Politicians like Paul Ryan are bought with over a million dollars to tell the world that climate change isn’t real. You can turn on Fox News and hear reporters exclaim that climate change is a hoax. This, I believe, should be illegal. It is not fair to American citizens to be brainwashed with this false information just because fossil fuel leaders want to be millionaires or billionaires. The term “fake news” has been coined by Trump and used wrongly--THIS is actually “fake news.” I believe that the carbotax is a genius idea. People all around the world hate paying more for something, so this would act as a reverse-psychology method to influence everyone to switch over to renewable energy. I hope that this becomes implemented soon, if not sometime during my life here on Earth.

     I agree with many of the points you made and have enjoyed reading this review. The fact that Leonardo DiCaprio received criticism for being appointed by the United Nations as one of the Messengers of Peace focusing on climate change bothered me because this was in no way him claiming to be in expert in the field. In fact, he made it clear in the documentary "Before the Flood" that he was embarking on this journey and learning with the rest of us. He also has had several years of experience educating himself in this topic and attending conferences so to doubt his credibility on the sole basis that he's an actor is inaccurate. Despite his profession, the fact that a mainstream celebrity is taking the time to use his platform to spread his knowledge and bring attention to a pressing issue that affects all of us is noteworthy, as many other celebrities don't make the best use of their public status.
<br><br>
Touching on your comment on DiCaprio's visit to India, this was also an important part of the film for me too. I knew that the consequences of climate change were in the foreseeable future and were inevitable if action wasn't taken now, but I didn't realize how parts of the world have already been largely affected. A farm in India was shown to be massively flooded, as it received half of the year's rainfall in the just five hours. This shocked me as I didn't realize that that could be possible, but also saddened me because the poor of the world are the ones having their livelihoods be the most affected. The irony in this situation is that the activities of the rich and the more developed nations are causing a great deal of the problem, and the poor are suffering the most.

The first aspect of this film that really jumped out to me beyond the important, captivating subject matter was the validity of having Leonardo Dicaprio as the center of the narrative. The film addressed this early on displaying some news reporters commenting on the un-qualified nature of this celebrity becoming an ambassador of peace. I struggled on coming to a conclusion for myself on this subject as I see both sides. I think it is very valid to question why an expert in the field or at least someone with formal education in the subject wasn’t chosen for this role. However, after finishing the documentary I understand why this award-winning actor was an appropriate choice for the cause. The film presented Leo’s genuine curiosity and commitment to these environmental issues, as he had been enriching himself in the issues from a young age. I also realized that having someone who wasn't an expert in the field was actually a completely intelligent and helpful choice as the viewer can learn alongside him. He is influential as he is widely known and respected and he is also accessible as he is not an expert but just an environmentally conscious person with a wand for change. This way any viewer could imagine themselves in Leo’s shoes and be motivated to the cause. I also felt that it was effective in the sense that they paralleled Leo against some of the most qualified, educated, and powerful leaders so there was no lack of sophisticated input.

For me, one of the most powerful parts of the movie was the conversation with the astronaut. I thought a really powerful image he presented was the metaphor of us getting to know the earth as an ant gets to know what an elephant looks like by climbing all over it. I think by him presenting both his perspective from space of what a beautiful planet earth is and his outlook on life through his dwindling days added such a striking message at the end of this narrative. He ties up this documentary of sadness and fear with a view of hope and faith in the human race that is so vital when trying to fix an issue so widespread.

The best thing I can say about “Before the Flood” is that it offers visual evidence that isn’t available to the majority of the public regarding the impact humans have on the physical appearance of Earth. The floods in Florida and the expensive and fail-predicted-future of Florida’s solution display how clueless society is about solving this issue. A helicopter’s view of a demolished forest and a collapsed 30 foot hose that had been previously snaked down into an ice berg are a few of the in-your-face pictures that emphasize the damage human consumption is doing to our Earth. It doesn’t require narration or context in order to convey the message that negative change is occurring. The movie is aiming to deliver the more crucial and controversial message, however, that human activity is the cause for all of this change.
                       <br><br>

Perhaps Leonardo DiCaprio is casted in the film for the purpose of appearing as a less controversial piece: this Hollywood actor is taking on the role of our “common ground”. He is representing “us” and exploring first-hand the effect our lifestyle is having in various locations around the world. However, it is strange to me that intermingled in these important experiences he is also shown meeting with Obama and the pope… It comes off as prestigious overkill in my opinion. What is probably an effort to build credibility has instead led me as a viewer to feel skeptical of the dialogue from the film. Including these people in such high positions of power seems like a cheap shot at ultimate persuasion. It almost supports the disbelief in the scientific evidence of those who object climate change by indirectly agreeing that the evidence is not enough to gain the support of the people.

<p>
The film, “Before the Flood” exacerbated the scope of issues surrounding climate change denial, fears, and the necessity for action. In watching the documentary, I noticed that one of the biggest issues with climate change denial surrounds the seemingly endless search for excuses and scapegoats to avoid addressing scientific facts and worsening problems. This was exemplified through the scrutiny Leonardo Dicaprio faced for being an “actor from Hollywood with no scientific background” when he tried to use his platform and star-status to bring attention to the issues caused by climate change. No differently, Greta Thunberg, the main voice of the youth climate movement, faces similar scrutiny for being “just a teenage girl” regardless of the international attention she continues to bring to the climate crisis and the reality of the situation. 
                       <br><br>
The issue at hand that has allowed the United States to continue to support climate change denial and thus do little to slow greenhouse gas emissions, fracking, and other environmentally degrading activities is one of greed, inequality, and corruption. Everything from banning the use of the term “climate change” by Floridian government officials, widespread disinformation campaigns, and the appointment of coal lobbyists to key positions in the EPA under the Trump Administration, has enabled the United States to take steps backward from addressing climate change in order to protect economic enterprises. 
                       <br><br>
By shedding light on the political and economic corruption within the United States Government, DiCaprio suggests that a solution rests in the power of the people to control elections and the interests of politicians. As described in the documentary, politicians are “puppets of the people.” If social movements, money, and public support are funneled into stronger environmental policies and government action to address environmental issues, we hold the power to shift the current political climate, and in turn, help our earth’s.

Everything you wrote here is exactly what I took away from the film. Thank you for the great review! I agree that climate change denial seems to stem from politicians essentially "beating around the bush". It's frustrating to see how much of a grip that oil companies have on Congress-- our planet's future is being compromised for what? The wealth of a handful of people? Regressive action like the U.S. backing out from the Paris agreement just to keep lobbyists happy is only making matters worse as well. I really enjoyed the layout of the documentary because it showcased the effects of climate change all around the world, especially in developing countries where the consequences would be a lot more severe. I also think it's important for people like DiCaprio, even if they might not be experts, to weigh in on issues like climate change because their efforts shed that much more light on them. I liked that the film provided the audience with some pointers at the end to show what steps people can take personally to both mitigate the effects of climate change and show their support for protecting the planet.
<br><hr>
In response to Marian Walker's comment, I would have to agree that in a few ways the scopes of climate change are exacerbated. I think the the plot and storyline of the protaganist seeking out the truth, in this case Leonardo Dicaprio, almost requires a bit of dramatic effect to get the point across. We know that the main character most likely does have knowledge of the issue at hand but perhaps this is the most effective way that the story can unfold. 
<br><Br>

I imagine this rhetorical device and story telling approach is used purposefully to represent the person that really doesn't know too much about climate change. By using this type of approach I'd imagine this can be seen as a "catch all" situation where everyone in the audience has something to learn. For example a climate novice would get a strong introduction to many of the themes and issues around climate change, someone with knowledge would get some new material perhaps, and even an expert would get some kind of review or at least be able to watch with a healthy skepticism.
<br><hr>

I also found it interesting how the film illuminated the constant judgment that environmental activists, such as Leonardo DiCaprio, face from climate change deniers. It seems that regardless of the source of information, it will somehow be criticized by those who benefit from climate change denial and deemed unreliable. It makes me curious about what kind of tools can and will be utilized by environmental activists in order to educate people and make them more aware of the severity of climate change and human activity's impact on it, or if there are tools available for this. 
<br><Br>

However, I disagree with the sentiment expressed in the documentary that politicians are "puppets of the people." As evidenced by the massive influence of lobbyists from the fossil fuel industry (who do not represent the people of the United States as a whole) on politics, it seems that politicians follow money. While public support and social movements are essential, I believe that the only ethical way the political aspect of climate change denial can be resolved is by restricting lobbying or banning it altogether to prevent the influence of money on policy-making.
<br><hr>
Personally, I love how the first thing you focused and went in depth on was the issue of "climate change denial, fears, and the necessity for action." I entirely agree with you that the biggest issue surrounding climate change is the fact that many do not want to believe in it and/or do not want to take action because they are denying it all together out of fear. Americans mainly are simply too comfortable with their lifestyle. If something is not directly affecting them and/or their own community, they give little to no mind to it. The United States is one of the biggest contributors to the driving forces of climate change, but because the effects that are happening now are happening in other, poorer parts of the world, we continue to live our wasteful and destructive lives until we ourselves see the damage we have caused in our own country. 

<br><Br>

On another note, I thought it was so interesting how the documentary, "Before the Flood" had many famous celebrities as the cast. I believe that having big names such Leonardo Dicaprio, Barack Obama, and Elon Musk was extremely beneficial towards the cause because it helps demonstrate that if these famous celebrities are concerned about climate change, then everyday civilians everywhere should be too. There were those who dismissed them by saying Dicaprio is just an actor like you said, but once again, I believe they simply did this out of fear of having to face the truth.
<br><hr>


I agree a lot with what you have to say.  As you state, the response which DiCaprio receives for being a climate activist who may not come from a scientific background shocks me.  I believe that it is important for those with a celebrity platform to come forward and speak out about political and social issues, because they are able to reach many people of different backgrounds with their voices.  I also find it surprising because it is the very people, news reporters, and politicians who are spreading hate towards Leonardo DiCaprio for doing so, that aren’t listening to what the scientists have to say.  So viewing this from their perspectives, why would his lack of scientific background matter? 
<br><Br>
 I didn’t personally realize prior to watching this film how much of an economic game climate change denial is. Although now, it makes complete sense.  While I have heard my fair share of climate change deniers, I didn’t realize how extreme it was. Hearing that officials in Florida were banned from even saying the words, as well as learning that climatologists were receiving what were essentially death threats was news to me. But as we learn that James Inhofe, one of the largest fossil fuel money recipients, was also one of the largest climate change deniers, I was no longer shocked.  
 <br><Br>
As we can see from the way that politicians are spreading falsehoods, motivated purely by money, money may be the only way to initiate change.  I agree with the professor who was speaking about a carbon tax, because whether we like it or not, people aren’t going to make changes to their daily lives unless motivated by something that appears more tangible to them, such as money.  It surprised me to see a republican so strongly on this side of things, but I think it was good to be able to understand that a tax increase isn’t even necessary, but merely a tax shift.
<br><hr>

I love what you said about the defamation of big figures such as DiCaprio and Thunberg being incited to distract people from the culminating issues that are building through the climate crisis. This distortion of the truth shaped by targeting the speaker is just another way people and big companies have found ways to evade the discussion of manmade climate change. I think that all movements have figureheads. It's an encouraging way to inspire change in people. When you see a sixteen year-old girl fighting for her future, you are inspired. Figureheads will be targeted though as to inadvertently target the movement itself. 
 <br><Br>

In the film "Before the Flood", DiCaprio crosses political, religious, geographic and ideological boundaries to find more information about anthropogenic climate change. This is a breath of fresh air in the mainstream media because it is looking to different points of view, not only to that of the USA or the Western World. In the segment where DiCaprio speaks to the woman from India, there is, in fact, a point of view that is brought up in contradiction to the lavish lifestyles of Americans and their habit to turn a blind eye to the damage they cause. The emissions that we create dwarf that of the other countries in the world, and yet we blame climate change on growing populations in underdeveloped countries that produce a minuscule fraction of our emissions. If the US thinks itself to be so influential and to have as much power and revenue as we claim, then WE should be making leaps and bounds in sustainability; doing everything we can to stop the climate crisis and helping other countries to do the same.
 <br><Br>

The public awareness that is brought up through this film is incredible in my opinion. Of course, there is still much to be said, but I think that this film makes the audience think about their personal lifestyles, the world, and our future as a planet.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that when celebrities use their platform to promote awareness the climate crisis, and any controversial topic for that matter,  they are criticized as not having an understanding about the entire scope. You don't have to be a scientist to be informed and educated about the climate crisis, and the fact that so many people will ridicule Decaprio while at the same time not using their own voice. It's astonish to me how people can see an act to promote positive change and then twist it into an attack of ones character. I believe that Dicaprio is correct in the fact that the people have the power the elect officials and make change using our democratic system. However, for me personally, I rememberer the 2016 electoral debates not talking about the climate crisis very often but more so the candidates attacking one another's character.
 <br><Br>

It is absurd to me that still so many people choose to ignore or bluntly reject the scientific proof that climate change is happening an exponential rate. The focus of the government to continue to participate in deforestation, mining of fossil fuels, etc, demonstrates that there was some form of corruption in our government, but its still astonishing to me how great an influence that money and power will go to influence how the government runs. In my opinion, to get real change to happen is has result in positive change in other areas as well. For example, to support a movement towards a primary plant based diet, we need to find a way to replace profits that the cattle industry provides. There needs to be made compromises and sacrifices from everyone to help create change, and while this doesn't have to be radical, it need to be progressing in moving towards a "better" future.
 <br><Br>

I have a question that is summarized from the reading:
 <br><Br>
How can we as a society make sure those within the government that deserve blame are held responsible?
<br><hr>



I agree that there is a worrying trend of dismissing important climate change ideas because of perceived issues with the ambassador of the message. Even if these ambassadors are not scientific experts, it is still important that they use their platform to spread these ideas because those climate change experts often do not have the necessary fame and influence needed to reach the public. 
 <br><Br>
I also agree that greed, inequality, and corruption have exacerbated the climate crisis. Companies that stand to gain from the destruction of the planet's natural resources–such as oil and gas companies or companies that destroy forests to create palm oil–should not have so much power in our government. The fact that these companies fund so many of the politicians in Congress is a testament to how greed has allowed the climate crisis to worsen. If we wish to try to reduce the effects of climate change, it is important to inform people and keep those profiting from these companies away from our government.
 <br><Br>
I believe that, as the video stated, it is important not only to take steps to reduce individual carbon footprints, it is also important to try to change our political system not only through voting, but also by participating in social movements such as protests and donating to causes that fight climate change.

<br><hr>

I found your connection between the backlash faced by Leonardo Dicaprio and Greta Thunberg to be fascinating. I feel as though both Thunberg and Dicaprio would not have the same platform without the traits they are criticized for. Dicaprio has been a big Hollywood name for years, giving him a huge audience across the world and allowing him to go beyond the typical image of the rich and famous and make a positive impact on the wellbeing of our planet. Although Thunberg did not begin her activism with a large platform, she was able to grow in popularity because of her passion at such a young age. Despite remaining composed and acting mature far beyond her years, I imagine it is discouraging to have her age constantly used against her, when, in an ideal world, young activists should be encouraged. I feel that their statuses do not necessarily mean they can not have an involvement in environmentalism, as their massive platforms are helpful in reaching more people and spreading awareness on these issues. Before watching Before the Flood, I admit to being a bit skeptical of Dicaprio’s involvement in the movement. I appreciated that he acknowledged his critics and even pointed out that he might not be the best person to do environmentalist work, as I am sure almost every viewer of the film had those same thoughts. However, I found the film to extremely effective in pointing out the current flaws in our society that are contributing to the issue of climate change, specifically the political state of the U.S. Despite the climate crisis being a world issue supported by scientific fact, it is still seen as a political issue and often ignored. Because politicians are often manipulative and act in a certain way only to get elected, it is difficult to imagine the climate crisis being seen as a legitimate issue that will be prevented by our government. However, I still have hope that we can change this problem, as more people become educated on the climate crisis through films such as this one.
<br><hr>

I agree with your view on the topic of Politics. It is actually quit an interesting topic: whether the basic environment for human survival is more important or the great human civilization is more important. Human civilization is surely incomparable, without it, we might just like other animals, living in the jungles and hunting through the mountains, just like normal animals. But without the basic environment, people only make the society greater and greater, hot water in the bowl will finally flow out one day, since the bowl is made of fragile paper. But nowadays, Politicians are just so focus on building the society, they forget the “bowl”. They add more salts of greediness to the bowl, making the water flow faster.
 <br><Br>


I also agree with  you that the film does effectively communicates its subject by using the personal views and explorations from the famous celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio through the whole film in order to effectively attract more people’s attention and influence more people. Moreover, the celebrity Leonardo tells the audiences his own personal experience about the nature and why he wants to protect it, which successfully make himself closer to the audiences and the audiences can listen to him willingly. Additionally, the film tries to warn people what we can do before the consequences cannot be saved by explaining how we are destroying the planet, such as different kinds of fossil fuels, and how we are trying to save it or ignore it, making people understand more the reasons behind.

Before the Flood documentary: Before the documentary even started I saw how long it was and groaned, but now I’m sitting here in the library and realized I had lost track of time because I was so invested in it that I didn’t notice it got dark out. That being said, I thought it was a very compelling way to inform the public of what was/is going on to this day with our environment. The images of what used to be the Boreal forest, which Leonardo DiCaprio stated, “kind of look like Mordor from Lord of the Rings”, the dead coral reefs, and small islands/coastal cities being destroyed or flooded were eye opening. As DiCaprio said, “The more I learn about it, the more I realize I don’t know.” It being climate change. 
 <br><Br>

The biggest thing that caught my attention was the fact that the U.S. is the number one emitter of CO2 but we put the blame on poorer countries like India, who still use coal to be able to give some form of electricity to many of their people, because its the cheapest alternative. Yet we don’t try to be a good example and move forward with making changes to the way we produce CO2. I believe the carbon tax might be a good way to promote people to consume less of it, but it seems nearly impossible to pass the bill with “fossil fuel funded climate change deniers” in power.

I found the film “Before the Flood” very informative and interesting. I am so happy that I was able to watch this film and learn a lot more about a lot of the specific issues happening in each country over the world from climate change. I really enjoyed how this film was set up with Leonardo Dicaprio traveling to different countries and speaking to many different people concerned about the climate crisis. It really gave us an insider’s perspective on how different people from many parts of the world feel about the issue of climate change. There were several things in this film that I found very interesting. One of the first things was when Leonardo Dicaprio visited Greenland. He was first informed that Greenland is going to completely disappear if climate change continues on this path because sea level is continuing to rise. The part that really shocked me was when I found out that hundreds of cubic kilometers of ice have melted already in Greenland in the past 5 years. This even shocked Dicaprio when they held out a long cord that showed how much ice actually had melted. The second thing I found interesting in this film was when Leonardo Dicaprio visited Indonesia. I learned facts about palm oil that I was never aware of before that absolutely shocked me. Palm oil is responsible for the success of many different companies. It is one of the cheapest oils and can be found nearly anywhere (food, makeup, etc). Because these companies want to maintain cheap palm oil, they are paying the government to burn down forests so they can obtain more palm oil. These forest fires in turn are releasing an immense amount of carbon into the atmosphere thus killing animals and threatening human lives as well. The Indonesia fire in one day releases more carbon than the entire US economy. 
 <br><Br>
I entirely agree with the idea of a carbon tax as well. This carbon tax will do exactly what it sounds like and place a tax on anything that releases carbon into the atmosphere. This in turn will make an incentive for people to consume less stuff that produces carbon. This carbon tax would make people take account of the costs, and it would nudge people to move to a more sustainable lifestyle. As of right now the politicians in place don’t believe climate change is occurring thus why we don’t have a carbon tax yet. Overall, if we don’t make serious changes our planet is going to be history. Coral reefs are going to begin to collapse before reaching a 2 degree increase. At a 3-4 degree increase, heat waves will make parts of the world unbearable to live in. These are just some of the FEW things that will happen if we don’t make a change.

I agree with you that the carbon tax is a good way to implement change to reduce climate change. I think this is a great start in reducing our use of carbon.
 <br><Br>

Leonardo Dicaprio takes a stand against climate change, however, many politicians discredit him because he is not any sort of scientist let alone an environmental scientist that has been doing research and studies in global climate change.  I think people should let others support a cause they believe in regardless of their expertise in the topic.  I also will give credit to people that will go out of their way to invest in a cause they support because like Leonardo Dicaprio he went to many different parts of the world to see with his own eyes the effects of climate change.  He has seen the depth in which the ice sheets have melted in Greenland and India where they have reduced their fossil fuel consumption by burning cow dung as a way to make food.  He has also discovered from speaking with Sunita Narain that the U.S. is a big factor in increasing climate change by emphasizing how American's consumption of electricity is about 1.5 times the amount as citizens of France and about 61 times the amount as the people of Nigeria.  The wealthiest countries are causing the most climate change and are the ones that can reduce climate change the most but are not doing so.  The less fortunate countries are the ones to affect the most since they can not afford to survive the changes of climate change like the wealthy countries can. 
 <br><Br>

Leonardo Dicaprio takes this knowledge into consideration and invests his time to talk to politicians who support the fact that climate change is real and very dangerous.  He has a talk discussing how they could reduce climate change and one major decision would be to implement a carbon tax.  However, many politicians do not support this because many Americans see tax as a bad thing and the politician that runs supporting this tax will not be elected among the people.  The politicians that support this tax explain that if this tax is added then they can reduce other taxes which eventually balance out how much tax is being put upon the U.S.  I would rather have the carbon tax and help the world than to be paying other types of taxes that have a less of an importance on the impact of life on the planet.  I think America realizes the climate crisis and wants to prevent the further cause of climate change, however, I believe many are not ready for the types of life changes that are required to make a significant decrease in climate change.

“Before the Flood” does a very good job in describing the problem that is climate change, as well as giving the audience a sense of urgency to make changes. I think that it was very effective since it created that sense of “panic”and urgency in me as well. For me, I’ve always known about climate change but not in great detail, rather just the overarching themes like melting ice and the rise of sea levels. This film did a great job of not only informing the viewers, but actually keeping them entertained as well by showing many of the issues first-hand, such as the pumps in Miami and the change to its infrastructure to prevent flooding.
 <br><Br>

At first, I was a bit dismayed when I saw that the protagonist of a climate change documentary was a Hollywood actor, Leonardo DiCaprio. However, the way that he framed the documentary and himself made it more appealing. It made it seem as if he was taking you along for the ride with him to learn more about climate change, rather than him trying to educate you. This became apparent when he stated that he was not an expert per se, but was trying to learn more. 
 <br><Br>

This film left me shocked in many aspects. In particular how corporations burn the Indonesian forests because it is profitable, and how politicians take money from the fossil fuel corporations and support their harming of the planet.

I think that there is a great truth in the fact that this film makes people feel motivated and angry enough to want to instill change in our climate crisis to begin with. I too only knew the basics about climate change, and this film did a phenomenal job in regards to explaining not only the minor and major details but gave such a broad amount of perspectives that allow intersectionality to really be visible. There is not just Miami's dangers involving infrastructure but how poor people or people in 3rd world countries are being affected as well. 
 <br><Br>

You are correct, Leonardo DiCaprio did a wonderful job educating us because he took us to actually view a multitude of different perspectives. He asked questions that we were curious about, and owned up to the fact that yes he may be a Hollywood actor but he is getting educated on this topic and so should we. We all could learn more when it comes to anything in life and we did. 
 <br><Br>

Politician's taking money from fossil fuel corporations is devastating to us because of the blatant corruption present. We want to do more and believe more but how are we supposed to do more when (non)elected officials- those with the most power- succumb to their greed. As for the fossil fuel corporations, the money growth of the 1 percent is nothing in comparison to the lives of billions. The fact also is, company owners do not care because at the end of the day, they will not suffer.

I often get so caught up with my daily life that I lose track of the issues that are facing today's society. The film “Before the Flood” actually made me take a step back and reanalyze my personal choices. I watched this film with my friend, and by the end, both of us were in a sort of shock and didn’t know what to say. Dicaprio, as well as the filmmakers, did an amazing job of captivating the audience and pushing them to open their eyes about this massive crisis that too many people are ignoring. Their approach was really interesting as the audience is learning with Dicaprio, which makes the film seem so much more personal and relatable. I think it's admirable that Dicaprio is using his platform for something so impactful, as most people are much more likely to listen to him than a random scientist they have never heard of. After watching I immediately felt the urge to do something, to make change any way I can. It made me question my whole lifestyle; what I eat, the products I buy, the car I drive. The portion of the movie where they spoke about meat consumption in the U.S shocked me and made me feel extremely guilty about my eating habits. The most impactful part of the movie for me was when they talked about palm oil production. The amount of trees that are being cut down and habitats being destroyed is too much to spare for just one ingredient we could easily do without. It's empowering to know that I, as a consumer, actually have some amount of power by choosing what I buy and what products I support. I wish I watched this movie sooner, as it made me change my whole outlook on today’s world.

It is one thing to read about climate change, read all the horrific statistics, facts and hear about the endless possibilities that can happen if we do not cease our activities; however, when those abstract ideas were visually displayed in the documentary “Before the Flood”, it impacted me to a whole other level. To begin, maybe one of the most effectual and shocking moments of the whole documentary was when Leonardo DiCaprio held the rope and walked away from the scientists to show us just how much ice has actually melted. The size of the rope was absolutely astonishing in my eyes, I never imagined that when scientists talk about ice melting in the arctic that they mean that hundreds and hundreds of feet of ice have already melted. In addition, growing up around snow during winter, It bothers me greatly that children in the next 100 years may not experience the beauty of a white Christmas or the thrill of riding a large baking tray down snowy mountains. Moreover, being a big beef consumer myself I was never fully aware of the extent that the cattle industry has on the environment and the genuine impact that I can make by just switching up my diet to other meats like chicken or fish. 
 <br><Br>

I think it is also ingenious how the documentary does not focus on climate change’s impact solely on the US pr on the West, but DiCaprio is seen flying all around the world visiting people and hearing many different stories about climate change, its impact and what is happening to prevent it all around the world. This clearly shows that climate change is in every sense of the world a global problem and therefore for the next subsequent decades all countries should band together and put climate change first as at the end of the day everyone, from every race, religion, gender, and socio-economic state will suffer from climate change one way or another. Despite this, the documentary showed me that there is still a large group of money-hungry politicians and businessmen that fear dwindling profits and losing power more than the current and future consequences of climate change. 
 <br><Br>

Nevertheless, the documentary also left me with a sense of hope and faith that the problem is not too far out of our reach and that it can be rectified if we all act and act quick. The fact that all it takes to switch the entire planet’s energy to sustainable forms are 100 of Elon Musk’s Gigafactory seems extremely doable and achievable if countries from around the world band together with their resources, expertise, and resources.

Before the Flood- This documentary on climate change is unique in the sense that it implements everyday life characters and routines that make the threat of climate change actually seem real. In particular, their use of Leonardo DiCaprio was one move I believe had the intention of attracting viewers by using a familiar and well respected name. Some argue that using DiCaprio might make this documentary less credible, and that might be so among highly educated audiences. But this film is easily accessible on Netflix, which implies this is film is meant to educate the "average joe" if you will. Regardless, DiCaprio has been a climate change activist for many years so I have no doubt he has an intense knowledge of the subject at hand. I also enjoyed how they included multiple examples of how climate change would impact the entire world, from Canada to Indonesia to the North Pole. Knowing this is a global problem puts how serious this issue is into greater perspective and also promotes a sense of urgency.


 <br><Br>


My favorite issue bought about by the film was that this problem is not soly the fault of the consumer, but corporate interest groups. Large corporations have failed time and time again to switch to sustainable methods of production and operate with no regards to the planet's health or humanity's future. One of the most major steps necessary to combatting climate change is to pass regulations requiring companies to produce sustainably, especially in the US and China. Until then, I fear humanity might not surviving the impending chaos our future holds.

The film "Before the Flood" has definitely opened my eyes more in regards to climate change and its severe implications. Living in a place where climate change has had a minimal effect on my life has numbed be to the harsh reality of it all. It was very disturbing to learn about how much and how rapidly the ice has been melting and the grave effects this will have throughout the planet even though the event itself it taking place thousands of miles away from me. It has helped to re-realize that the actions of each individual play a significant role in the status of our planet. \

 <br><Br>

Using Leonardo Dicaprio for this role was a good choice. Although he is not very credible in the scientific world, he is able to grab people's attention and as a person with status he can be an exceptional advocate for the climate crisis.

I agree with your thoughts on how living in California has made us somewhat oblivious to climate change which is why I am glad the film showed the disastrous effects of it across the world because without them we could easily go on knowing it's an issue but not actually see what it's doing.  For example, we are experiencing more fires than ever before in California but after they are contained we tend to move on with our lives. Without seeing lasting effects like smog we are less likely to be as adamant and progressive as we should be. The toughest part about all this is getting those in power to care just as much as us. People can say what they want about our nations fossil fuel consumption but things are only going to get worse without action.

After watching “Before the Flood,” I finally got the wake up call that I wasn’t truly ready for. I thought that “The Uninhabitable Earth” did a very good job in terms of addressing the main issues in regards to climate change, but “Before the Flood” really showed these issues happening all around the world in a documentary for people to see the truth in concrete terms. I was shocked to see how climate change is affecting so many regions of the world and yet there are so many deniers of climate change in the world today. What baffles me the most is how politicians get away with directly denying climate change by stating “Man can’t change climate.” Politicians are a huge source of knowledge for many people in America especially, so when politicians speak about the benefits of fossil fuels and deny climate change, many people agree with them. This is a huge problem because America is one of the most influential countries in the world and the biggest spender of fossil fuels with no remorse for its effects on other countries, and even within our own country.
 <br><Br>

It was very saddening to see how the media suppresses the drawbacks of fossil fuels and how corporations figure out ways to make fossil fuels seem to have no correlation to climate change. Seeing that the rising of sea levels will destroy many islands and people around the world was devastating to me. Although Miami and other developed cities and countries are most likely going to see this problem in the near future, what made me most sad was to see this same thing happening in developing countries where people have barely any options when it comes to finding different housing. 
 <br><Br>

Some parts of the documentary made me hopeful. I loved seeing Leonardo Dicaprio’s role in this film because it showed me that influential people in America are taking stand against climate change and fossil fuels so maybe more people will understand the consequences of emitting greenhouse gases. Also, seeing how sophisticated countries like Denmark and Sweden are when it comes wind and solar energy was a very positive note to end on because it shows that if these countries can make a change for the better, why can’t we.

Now call me a cynic, but nothing about the parts of the film about the greed of politicians and media companies surprised me. For centuries, large corporations and others in positions of extreme wealth have financially influenced public figures to skew the truth and spread information that benefits them. If you have the time, I suggest that you go onto opensecrets.org and look at the funders/companies that "donate" to campaign runs. Many of these companies are motivated to continue support for industries involving the burning of fossil fuels, meat consumption, etc. Just as Leonardo Dicaprio said in the film, "Politicians, whether we call them elected leaders, are really elected followers." In regard to media companies pushing out misinformation about the climate crisis, it's the exact same deal. Partisan politics absolutely control the media, as you can see with FOX News and even MSNBC. It is our duty to be diligent and identify information and sources that do not release information that sacrifices truth for money.

In “Before the Flood”, a film about the drastic effects humans have on the environment, Leonardo Dicaprio helps illustrate our ecological footprint. I thought that the film was so eye-opening and inspiring, and ultimately made me feel uneasy about our planet's future. One particular scene that caught my eye was when Dicaprio was in the helicopter overlooking the destroyed forest, now used for oil mining. 
 <br><Br>

I really like how the nature of politics intertwined with the discussion of climate change. I learned that the growing denialism of global warming is due to corporations manipulating the population in order to keep their corporate profits. Fueled through their interest of fossil fuel profits, politicians are denying the actual science of climate change. 
 <br><Br>

The politics and discussion of consumption in different countries also taught me alot, as I learned about the different perspectives of foreign countries such as China and India. Cries for help in countries such as India is growing, due to the substantial amount of CO2 the U.S. pumps out each year. This causes terrible backlash in Indian counties, with one example(shown in the film) of excess rainfall on their farmland. These countries taught me about the importance of fighting climate change, not only for ourselves, but for everyone else.
 <br><Br>


Another point made in the film that I liked was its emphasis on our destruction to our beautiful wildlife. For example, the film shows that climate change has terrible effects for coral reefs, as 50% has disappeared due to massive CO2 consumption. Our overuse of fossil fuels destroys these reefs who host and maintain ecosystems for many populations of fish. 
 <br><Br>


I really liked how Dicaprio was centered in the film, it not only helped me to recognize a familiar face, but helped me to understand that no matter who you are, you can always do something about the destructive nature of climate change. Dicaprio's role inspired me to look within myself and think about ways I can make my carbon footprint less heavy. Whether it be at the grocery store, at home, or in class, I know realize that every factor contributes to lessening the overall CO2 emissions we put into the atmosphere.

Like yourself I also considered the interconnection of politics and climate change to be an interesting prospective into the topic. It is fascinating how China has implemented an environmental plan called the Green Leap Forward to stop and prevent any more carbon dioxide emission. As part of their plan, Chinese government has mandated companies to provide information about their CO2 emissions and these numbers are then published online and reported on news-networks in order to create a sense of transparency between the companies and the people. The people can then act on the given information and demand change from the companies and hold them accountable for their promises. Besides creating a sense of transparency, the government is also making an effort to cut down on fossil fuel and in return create green technology. The Chinese government has taken the initiative to start the change, however, the U.S has fallen behind. Due to U.S incompetence to recognize the climate change due to money hunger congress men, the climate crisis is still ongoing and will progress to greater extents.

Al Gore's film, "An Inconvenient Sequel" provides interesting insight into the political world in relation to environmental issues. Politics are often hid from the public and are generally the top reason why environmental progression is halted in countries. Seeing the behind the scenes of debate over environmental topics is very informative and interesting. Such as Indias hesitation to join the Paris Accord. India argued they should be able to utilize fossil fuels to develop their country just as all the other major countries have done, such as the United States. Similarly, watching Gore's efforts to get India to go solar through business deals and negotiations was not only entertaining, but also touching. In English 22 we saw many politicians stray away from supporting environmentalism, so to see Gore's commitment to the issue was refreshing. Al Gore made a couple strong arguments that should make even those who don't care about the environment consider renewable energy. Gore highlighted how China and some republican cities are going solar due to the economic benefits. The use of economics is a smart strategy when trying to appeal to a large audience. Making and saving money is something that intrigues people world wide, and by connecting renewable energy to economics, Gore makes environmentalism something that isn't just for democrats.

I completely agree with your response to "An Inconvenient Sequel" and appreciate that you as well found the political side of the environmental crisis as interesting as I did. Similar to you, I took English 22 which I believe made me pretty well versed in the climate crisis however as you mentioned we rarely got to see politicians push for environmental consciousness. Throughout "An Inconvenient Sequel" I was consistently reminded of the film "A Climate of Doubt" which was the opposing perspective of the environmental debate, which in short argued that climate change was a fallacy created by corporations for profit. While this type of ignorance is obviously frustrating, it was a huge relief to see someone in a high position of political power, such as Al Gore fight for the environment when in all reality it wouldn't have much personal effect on his life as a upper class American man.
 <br><Br>

Another thing that I found extremely interesting was the fact the film presented the behind the scenes effort of the climate crisis, for example the political meetings between Al Gore and India as well as a bit of insight into the power of congress when trying to tackle environmental concerns. Yet again, a trend throughout the course material is that the main competition to progressing climate change efforts is large capitalist industries such as the oil, coal and meat industries who seemingly care about profit over the quality of human life. Which in response, the economic approach presented throughout the movie which demonstrated the profit of clean energy and the push for solar across the USA was important to combat the materialistic ideals of the opposing side which prefer to optimize profit over any other concern. I would highly recommend this film to my friends and family because it goes deeper into the climate concern while also showing the political process which in turn emphasizes the need for political unity in order to spark change.
<br><hr>
Honestly, this has been something that's been bothering me for a while. I've seen it in An Inconvenient Sequel and Before the Flood, where India gets to be the token "global opposition to climate change", prioritizing their own internal development over the global efforts to fight climate change. What's really remarkable to me, however, is how much the two movies dance around the point that American Republicans are basically the biggest opposition to climate change in the world right now - a watcher of these two movies would come away with the impression that the biggest problems would be India, and nebulous "powerful fossil fuel interests", and I do not think that holds up; if America was to truly leverage its wealth and power towards resolving the crisis, most of the rest of the world would be happy to work with us. To me, then, the key revolves around truly leveraging America's power - and that starts by voting the reactionaries out and the progressives in.

Before watching “Before the Flood,” I was not aware that Leonardo DiCaprio immersed himself in the environmental movement, despite his acting background. It was quite interesting to see the criticism he received from the media for such inexperience. However, the film convincingly portrays him as an active participant in fighting environmental degradation. The film captured DiCaprio’s perspective through first-person commentary, and, through this commentary, we can see his growth to the realization of the complexity of the issues within the scope of climate change. The film shows him traveling around the world to get a broad view of the reaches of this issue. What especially stuck out to me was the inclusion of global warming’s impact on the poor communities of places like the Pacific Islands and Indonesia that contribute the least to anthropogenic climate change yet experience firsthand its results. 

 <br><Br>

After watching “Before the Flood,” I would say that the film impacted my view on my role in the climate crisis. The film took the perspectives of all groups of people, from the delegates signing at the Paris Climate Accord to Barrack Obama during his presidency, and even to Pope Francis’s delivery of his encyclical on the environment, we see a collective call to action for the end of anthropogenic climate change. I really liked that the film was centered on the painting “The Garden of Earthly Delights” that remained a personal reference for DiCaprio because it motivated him to prevent a catastrophic ending for the Earth.

I completely agree with your statement.  Similarly, I was not completely aware of DiCaprio's involvement with environmental issues.  While he is a famous white man in America, I also thought it was interesting that he not only took responsibility for all that he has done, but also taught himself about the issues that face poorer nations, those who will be the most effected by climate change.  I also thought an interesting part of this film was that he not only traveled to many different places, but he also talked about different issues that impact those areas.  For example, sea level rise will effect places like Miami, but deforestation for palm oil is the principle issue in Indonesia rainforests.  I agree that it was interesting to see a broad variety of interviewees.  DiCaprio spoke to political leaders, climate scientists, and concerned citizens.  Finally, I loved that the film was centered around the painting.  I felt that it was a really emotional film, and after hearing all he had to say, seeing the painting at the end brought it full circle.

In “An Inconvenient Sequel,” Al Gore emphasizes the importance of connecting science to policy. Companies who are destroying the potential of solar panels and other forms of renewable energy are losing the last opportunity they have to save the Earth. Companies are more focused on making profit over trying to invest on a problem that will only get worse over time and cost even more. The government seems to be ignoring all of the warning signs of global warming and climate change, such as the destructive typhoon that occurred in the Philippines in 2013 that killed thousands of people and the record breaking drought in Syria that destroyed 60% of their farms. These storms will only get stronger and more destructive if the climate crisis is ignored. The U.N. Paris Conference gave many people hope that countries and companies will start to transition to renewable energy and control the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that enter our atmosphere. We need to fix the democracy crisis to fix the environmental crisis as Al Gore stated. The United States also has an important role of leading the rest of the world in making change like using renewable energy. Although the Paris Agreement seemed to be one step closer to better environmental regulation, I have not seen much change occur in terms of companies controlling how much carbon emission enters the atmosphere. The film demonstrated that very few people hold power and control over these decisions. Many of these changes are in the hands of powerful authority figures. It seems hopeless when the only people who can take charge are ignoring all the warning signs of climate change.

I agree that the people who have the power and authority to do something about climate change are the ones who will lose their profit if we switch to renewable energy. These companies fail to see that they will lose more than money if climate change is to worsen. The people in power are not even the ones who are suffering the greatest from climate change. It is the poorer parts of the world that are suffering the greatest because all of these plants are being built in poorer areas. I feel that the people who have the power to do something about climate change chose to ignore it because they feel like it does not affect them, especially not to the extent that it does in poorer countries. I also agree with how we were given hope because of the Paris Agreement but no major change happened after that because the people who are in power still chose to ignore this massive problem. In the film when Al Gore is teaching others about the effects climate change, he tended to get frustrated a lot when discussing the issue because people continuously chose to do nothing. Throughout the film, Al Gore has gained a lot of support and even shaped leaders for this movement and in doing so, it  still is not enough because companies and the people with power chose not to listen. I agree that the government does have the power to do something about this but chose to ignore the problem. It is hard to see how they believe that climate change is not a real issue when parts of the world are being flooded and sinking and people are dying. It is not right for the government to be ignoring an issue this serious and urgent. Lastly, I agree with how not a lot of change has occurred in terms of preventing climate change. I feel that if the government would do something about climate change then the issue would not be as urgent as it is now. In some parts of the world, people can not even see the blue sky or go outside for long amounts of time. All these people can see is fog and companies continue to build more plants that release these gases into the air. I feel that this documentary was very effective in explaining the urgency of this issue by showing how the temperatures have changed from the 1900s til now and how more and more of the bell curve was shifting to the warmer side as the years went by.

"An inconvenient sequel” was a great film that highlighted the political and social issues that correlate with climate change. The goal of this film was obviously to bring to life the detrimental issues that the climate crisis is causing all over the world. The most heartbreaking part of the film was when al gore interviewed a man who had been in the philippines when the typhoon hit and had to watch as others around him perished in the raging waters while fighting for his life. The sheer thought of having been in  his situation makes me scared for this climate crisis to go any further yet there are people who still believe that the issues in the environment are not important or that they simply don't exist. Donald  trump used an example of political figures that deny the proof of global warming, and seeing as he is not the president it is no wonder that the united states still refuses to cut back on CO2 emission even though we are a global powerhouse. As a global leader I believe the United States should be contributing to the global goal of a cleaner earth because even if leaders in our country don't see the climate issues the sociological issues cased are quite visible. This climate crisis has the largest impact on the poor and underdeveloped nations, for example when syria faced major droughts they lost 80 percent of their livestock which created mass hysteria, panic and poverty. This is obviously a pressing matter with a short deadline and gathering like the Paris conference are small yet important steps that we need more of to get people attention of an pressing matter. Wind and solar are great innovations for renewable energy and at the rate they are being manufactured the cost in decreasing allowing for widespread users from companies to homeowners. Yet we see setbacks due to large companies using corporate cash to try and stop the progress. For example when ford bought the la subway system to make sure LA stayed a car commuting and buying city. Sad to see but a Capitalist society without major changes we won't be able to see a greener tomorrow.

“Before the Flood” was a thought-provoking, yet alarming documentary. I’m very surprised that it didn’t get as much traction as it should’ve, since it calls attention to so many important red flags regarding the climate crisis. As other students have previously stated, it was quite interesting to see Leonardo DiCaprio spearhead the entire documentary. Even though some saw it as a strategic popularity stunt, there are others who agree that it was effective. I think it’s definitely important to understand the situation through a less educated person’s eyes rather than scientists and environmentalists. That way, us viewers are able to interpret the issue in an authentic way because of how much we respect and resonate with the actor. The fact that he’s an actor who’s had to face these climate issues through his movie production “The Revenant,” we’re able to see that he has a motive for embarking on this journey. Instead of basking in fame and focusing on the finer things like most of the Hollywood/film industry, he uses his platform and power to understand more about the dangers of the climate crisis.
 <br><Br>
 Through gathering intel and data of multiple reliable sources around the world, including former President Barack Obama, DiCaprio does an excellent job of giving us the information we need to spread awareness and take action. In just two years of filming this documentary, DiCaprio saw crops being washed away, flooded streets in Miami, and melting of ice caps in the North and South pole, it’s terrifying to know how rapid the rate at which this occurring at. Yet, the vast majority of the world’s population hasn’t budged, myself being included. I admit that it’s so easy to be ignorant of these issues when deadly resources are handed to you for everyday use. The way we live now is the product of the rapid burning of fossil fuels, and how easy it is to access them.
  <br><Br>
Obviously, there is no simple solution to this crisis since it heavily involves politics and economics. However, spreading awareness and getting people to change their lifestyles is the only way to start. As the film states, if fossil fuel taxes went up, then consumption would go down. However, stubbornness and thirst for money/profit have desensitized the entire world population to this situation. It’s kept them ignorant to the very thing that may end them. To me, that is truly saddening to see.

After watching the film "An Inconvenient Sequel," the critical role that politics plays on handling the climate crisis quickly became evident to me. In fact, one of the examples from the film that most stood out to me was when the Bush administration took office, they quickly unfunded a NASA space satellite equipped with climate monitoring research tools. Al Gore points out that this could be largely due to the fact that Bush relied on major oil companies funding in order to obtain political power. The fact that money and political scheming trumped scientific research in this instance troubled me because I believe  that the problem of climate change should simply not be a partisan or even political issue. There has been indisputable evidence and research conducted that clearly depicts a correlation between the climate and anthropogenic activity. Even today under the Trump administration, I believe the issue of climate change is once again being wrongly neglected, as seen in the withdrawal of the Paris agreement. As the man from Texas in the film said, "We have a moral and ethical obligation to leave the earth better than we found it." Although simple, this quote resonated with me. We know our actions on this earth are having effect on our home, so why would we not at least try our best to preserve it. Ultimately, without political powers supporting infrastructural change to better the climate, this video made me realize the importance of things such as climate strikes, and individual efforts to change to a more sustainable lifestyle. 

 <br><Br>

Lastly, I found Gore's discussion with developing countries leaders interesting. The developing countries make a solid argument when they claim they have the same right to fossil fuels as countries such as the US in order to reach the same level of development. This idea is dangerous however, especially since their populations are the greatest in the world. Ultimately, we must find some way to develop their infrastructures in a way that does not rely on fossil fuels like the developed countries today otherwise I see little hope for a reduction in CO2 emissions.

<p>
An Inconvenient Sequel: This film talks about what do climate changes bring to the world like floods and Typhoons. In the film, Al Gore holds a lot of meetings world-wide and he goes to TV shows and international conference meetings just for hoping people can realize that everyone on earth should take action for reducing CO2 right now.
 <br><Br>
However, to wake up some people are not easy, there are a lot of obstacles in progress. DSCOVR was proposed by Gore for warning Earth in the event of solar magnetic storms. Due to political changes, some governors decided to shut down DSCOVR and store it. Gore put huge mount of effort into this, but all this could be rejected due to politics.
 <br><Br>
One more thing in the film that touches me is about Gore’s fighting in Paris United Climate  Change Conference2015. Many presidents in the conference promised that they would replace dirty caused resources into new clean energy, but India’s prime minister Modi insisted that India is still in progress of quick Indus development, so it is inevitable to burn coals to produce energy. Gore also talked to local Indian governors, and one of them questioned Gore how does this explain for developed countries? Did they burn coals 150 years ago? Gore considered this, and he tried to convince Solarcity to give their technology to India. At the end of the conference, India signed the agreement. Undoubtedly, Gore played an important role for this conference.

<p>
The impact which humanity has had on the environment was clearly shown though this documentary. The actions which we take towards transportation and energy are some of the major contributors to climate change, and the necessity of change is extraordinarily high. Since the documentary was filmed, so much has happened with the state of climate policy which is not moving humanity towards sustainability. In addition, I did not realize the outsize impact which beef has on our farmlands and on the environment. The contents of our diet is clearly one of the most important ways in which we can take steps towards reducing our carbon emissions.

<p>
In discussion of these two films together, I think the focus on approach is a very interesting perspective to analyze. Before the Flood opens up with this vulnerability and acknowledgement of Leonardo DiCaprio’s lack of expertise, which in itself is an effective rhetorical choice to make as it adds relatability and really brings the viewers on the trip with him. On the other hand, An Inconvenient Sequel spends much of its film directed towards convincing viewers to see and accept Al Gore’s credibility as someone worthy and knowledgeable enough to speak on these matters.
 <br><Br>


I find Before the Flood to be effective at communicating its subject through its immersive narration style. The movie opens up with DiCaprio’s voice over, easing in his life story and experiences, bringing a natural start and purpose to this film for the audience to make first connection with. This film addresses in a way that tries to put fear and weariness in its audience by pressing the issue in a eery, scary manner, pushing the idea that man may be unwittingly changing the world’s climate through various waste products of the civilizations. There are so many chaotic cuts in the beginning that really add to the effectiveness to the film communicating its seriousness and the topic of the climate crisis.

 <br><Br>

I was actually surprised to learn that DiCaprio was appointed as the United Nations Messenger of Peace on climate change. I think what makes having him take this role, and being apart of this movie, makes this film so effective, is that not only is he a big name figure that many people recognize, but also the fact that he delivers his character as an incredibly relatable position. He shows his vulnerability as someone who is not an expert, like most of us, and wants to do anything he can to learn about the issue and what he can do to help it. DiCaprio’s role in this film caused me to directly apply myself into the film and his stance, which was great for promoting a more optimistic view in that I can be like him, set a role model, and look actively for ways to address the issues. A huge factor to this film is in the relatability they try to push, and how every one of us can make a difference even as a normal citizen. This film also crosses countries, China, India, and more to show how global of an issue this is and how we are all interrelated.
 <br><Br>

A final comment on An Inconvenient Sequel is just to touch on how Gore’s prior experience as a Vice President for two terms, really brings an open door to really trust him with his behind the scenes knowledge of how politics run, which is in fact big part in environmental issues (which would be more directly referred to as environmental politics).

<p>
The most profound thing that stuck with me in regards to "An Inconvenient Sequel" was the breakdown of the Paris Agreement. I have never fully understood what the agreement actually was and what steps were being taken. I understood that it was unacceptable that the USA pulled out of it, but I didn't understand why. 
  <br><Br>
I now see that it is an honor-based pledge, to keep the overall temperature rise down by reducing emissions. I was shocked however that there seems to be no accountability system and that temperatures have already risen ⅔ of what the agreement had allocated itself. The Usa should be pressured into rejoining by other nations and the citizens of the Usa. I also believe there should be some form of accountability for meeting emission goals. 
  <br><Br>
I find the politics of climate change very frustrating as not only are decisions made slowly, but they are also made with big donors such as the coal and oil industry donating money to politicians for reelection in order to stall the conversation on climate change.

I really enjoyed this film and the fact that someone with the means of helping is doing all that they can to not only educate themselves but others. I thought the painting was really cool. Leonardo must have never imagined that a painting of his childhood could tie into was it essentially becoming his life’s work. It was hard to watch the film and the big call to action it was making to immediately combat climate change because I realized that the documentary was filmed in 2016. A main indicator of this while I was watching the film was the fact that Leonardo was talking to President Obama. It made me sad watching the part about the Paris Climate Agreement. They kept saying that there were no repercussions for not abiding by the agreement but that everyone had to have faith in each other. Yet here were are in 2020, and one of the biggest emitters of carbon/creators of climate change has backed out of the agreement. We discussed the Paris Climate Agreement in ES 1 and wondered why any of the other countries who are barely the cause of the problem should keep trying. Without the U.S. doing something big and becoming the global leader it claims to be, the climate problem may never be fixed. I still believe in people doing their part and changing to more environmentally friendly lives but I also don’t think anything will change if our government won’t.

After watching this film, I agree that this film unravels the truth regarding climate change. I think that Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job in the film introducing the topic of climate change while touching on the many causes which is difficult to do in one film. I was honestly surprised at how much he partook in trying to help climate change and did not know that he was involved at all until this film. I think using someone that many people recognize is familiar and an effective approach as he becomes the main character and he takes us on a journey to discover the many causes of climate change while also meeting with very sophisticated people in order to get 1st hand experiences and answers. One of the main parts that particularly stood out to me was one of Leonardo DiCaprio's statements that before we would advocate making small changes such as our light bulbs or saving water in order to prevent all of this mayhem to occur. However, he said that now we are in it and those small changes won't make a big enough improvement. We need to start taking action now and not just small independent actions but one's that can really make an impact. Additionally, I found the conversation he had with Sunita Narain who was part of the center for science and environment in India. She said that in India they are all about climate change but not every Indian can access environmentally friendly energy. This made a strong impact on me because Indians are unable to afford these types of energy and resort to using coal. The real problem is within the United States as our consumption is the most in the world, while people in India don't even have the energy, to begin with. Even China is making big changes while the United States is the biggest contributor to climate change. Leonardo DiCaprio said, "if China can do it that we can do it". This statement is very true as the United States contributes the most to polluting our earth, this means we should make the most effort to try to help the earth.  Overall, I think that this film did a great job introducing the topic of the climate crisis and I would recommend everyone to watch this even if they are already involved with the issue. The approach of this film by travelling the world meeting many different people and showing how the United States is practically failing at helping with climate change is very effective for the viewer.

Film-Before the Flood
  <br><Br>
Man, I actually thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Not only was an emotionally moving and captivating piece, but it was also quite informative in it's portrayal of climate change through the eyes of Leo DiCaprio. Through the eyes of DiCaprio, the viewer is able to be taken on a journey all across the world to understand and appreciate the importance of the crisis ahead of us. A part of me felt a little heartfelt for those who aren't worldwide famous millionaires who don't get the opportunity to explore the problem climate change all around the world. However, through this movie, we are not only able to witness it all for ourselves through DiCaprio's journey, but we can observe the types of actions being taken by all the higher powers. 
  <br><Br>

The fact that all aspects of climate change were explored in all places of the world, from the slums of india, to the city of miami or even the small culture of Pacific Island, me as a viewer could truly feel how we are all in this together. What took me aback the most was the fact that the United States is the 2nd leader in contributing to climate change unfortunately. Sadly this is probably the last thing i'd wan't this country to be leading in, and it's apparent to people around the world. People like Sunita Narain want to hold America accountable for the impact in not only influencing the world as a world power, but as a giant obstacle in the race to fight climate change. 
  <br><Br>

By the end of the film, I felt reassured. Not that everything was going to be ok, like any other movie's resolution, but that it was clear where work needed to be done and were change could arise from. Like DiCaprio's moving speech to the UN, the responsibility is on US as individuals to work collectively to change the culture.

    I also agree that it was informative yet amazing to witness the portrayal of climate change through the eyes of Leonardo DiCaprio. It offers a sense of appreciation while educating viewers on the severity of the climate crisis, along with the steps being taken in order to combat the detriment of this crisis. I like how you touched base on the United States’ role as one of the largest contributors to climate change across the globe and marked the importance of the country being held accountable for its actions and influence the rest of the world, while  hindering the fight against the climate crisis. I also appreciated this because the United States is often portrayed as perfect throughout media and in terms of its political agenda, yet it is one of the leading contributors. The United States has a responsibility in aiding in the perseverance of our planet through direct planning and action. 
  <br><Br>
Before the Flood shed light on an area of farmland that was completely dismantled by rain in as  little as 5 hours. Prior to this course, I read an article which revealed how climate change will be responsible for producing a surplus of climate migrants across the globe. This population will primarily stem from vulnerable populations residing  in developing countries who have less access to resources and shelter that will aid in protecting them from the detriment unleashed by global warming. The moment in the film stood out to me because it showcased how individuals residing in developing countries are currently dealing with the repercussions of climate change. Many of us are privileged enough to the point where we do not witness the firsthand effects of rising temperatures, which may minimize the severity of the climate crisis in our minds and priorities. This forces the audience to realize that our actions are directly impacting fellow human beings in the present day. 
  <br><Br>
Another key topic revealed in the film is also centered around the United States’ role in this crisis, directing the viewer's attention towards the United States government. The film states how Congress contains 131 “climate deniers,” while the Senate contains 38. The chair of the  Senate’s environment committee has received nearly two million dollars from the fossil fuel industry. He is amongst an extensive list of senators and other government workers who receive fossil fuel funds. The film stresses the difficulty in passing bills that advocate for the wellbeing of the climate and plant when the Senate is constituted of climate change deniers who refuse to support bills that will address the environmental problems at large.

The film “An Inconvenient Sequel” focuses on former vice president Al Gore in his attempts to reconnect the public in being environmentally aware of the changes happening around us. He talks about Miami and how “flooding is an issue” and authoritative figures “are ignoring environmental issues” at hand (18:50). In Florida, the fact that the state governor does not meet with scientists about sea level rise further shocked me due to it impacting the people through issues such as homelessness due to flooding. If people are not helped by the higher power, what does the higher power even do? While watching this film, it really helped me contemplate about power and the public. Those in higher power seem to be biased in their stances upon certain topics like how one of the Senates did not even give Al Gore a chance to speak about climate change. I really thought it was important how he made a boundary between environmental and political topics because the people around him would always connect his political views with environmental ones as seen with his news interview. Although this film takes place in the past, it helps us reevaluate and refresh knowledge on historical events in order to better understand the present. 
  <br><Br>


In relation, the film “Before the Flood” also talks about pressing matters of climate change and rising temperatures through the perspective of actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio. I thought this film was similar to the sequel in a way that Al Gore also went out of his way to seek the truth about certain topics from other qualified professionals. Opinions can only be validated when supported by evidence. From statistical evaluations to discussing environmental issues, DiCaprio speaks up about the importance of being environmentally aware and seeking this truth behind what really is going on with the earth.

I also watched the documentary "An Inconvenient Sequel"  and found the same points about people in power not caring about the way their citizens are affected by climate change and refusing to acknowledge it as an issue to be shocking and almost frustrating. It's sad to see that most of the people who can actually make changes on a large scale (like politicians) are so greedy to get rich that they don't see the value in investing money "today" into renewable energy resources to save the planet and have a tomorrow. I hope that this will begin to change by creating more incentives (like carbon taxes) to switch to renewable resources and by educating more of the public to understand how crucial of a problem the climate crisis really is. The film gave me a lot to think about and I think you did an excellent job pointing out one of the main issues that should be talked about, which is that many of our government officials do not actually want what is best for us, but rather what is best for their wallets.

<br><Hr>

I did not watch the film " An Inconvenient Sequel", but I do see the connection to some things mentioned in " Before the Flood" that I found quite interesting as well; you mention that authoritative figures in the film were also said to be ignoring the importance of the environmental issues. It is quite disappointing to see that those with higher power are the ones who refuse to take action. In the case that Al Gore 'attempts' to reconnect the public with the issues , shows how much more power and control politicians have.

Before the Flood: I believe this film is very effective in stressing the necessity of taking action against climate change now. Leonardo DiCaprio serves as an effective narrator because of his long stance against climate change, and his ability to easily influence others because of his celebrity status (which he is putting to great use). Leo takes us along for the ride as he travels all over the world, showing visuals of the effects of climate change happening today, and conversing with experts and locals on the grave effects happening, and how to further prevent more. Although Leo was appointed a UN messenger of peace, he admits he is not an expert, and that he may even be the “wrong guy” for the position because of his pessimistic attitude. He may be utilizing reticence when he says this because he is certainly very intelligent and has been a strong advocate for climate change for many years, but he does not reflect ignorance. I respect how Leo is brave enough to tell the world he isn’t an expert, but he is constantly putting in the work to help the planet. His humility is relatable which makes people listen to him more. 
  <br><Br>

The UN secretary-general who appointed Leo, described the earth as a sinking boat, which we will all sink in, together. As Leo points out, so many people believe climate change is out of our control, and climate denialists believe its a fictitious problem and so they tune it out. I related to Leo when he said he felt angry that groups of settlers would wipe out entire species, because when I was younger and I learned that I could never see dodo birds, I too was angry. Yet, it's even worse that right now we are wiping out entire species, while knowingly doing it and on a much larger scale. 
  <br><Br>

What angers me the most about everything that is happening, is the people who continually deny it, in the name of profit. As always, everything is about money, and the fossil fuels industry is enormous. Politicians want more profit, and they make the climate change issue political and divisive, when it's an issue any and all parties should be concerned about. And like one interviewee in the film said, we don’t have time to argue about this. One of my favorite parts of the film was when Leo travelled to India, exploring how developing countries add to the growing problem, and what they need to change in their daily lives. The indian woman brought up very good points, that 300 million people in India don’t even have power, and 7000 million use cow dung-not coal-for energy. While America is trying to push other countries to make sacrifices, it hasn’t even moved towards solar power yet. Americans take pride in being the most powerful country in the world, so they should start making larger moves towards renewable energy to set an example to other countries.  
  <br><Br>

As Leo ended the film with: we must change the way we live, what we consume, how we get involved, and who we vote for.

Before the Flood - This film served many purposes to me. Typically, when Leonardo Dicaprio is beautifully displayed in front of me for an hour and a half I enjoy every second, but this documentary was an exception. The fact that many policy makers, those in power to cause actual change, do not even believe in global warming is astonishing-- going as far to even ban the phrase “climate change” by Florida officials. Taking the audience on a journey with Dicaprio proves to be an effective rhetorical device, as this is more engaging than just spewing facts and antagonising the audience. I watched this film with three other classmates, all of which had similar reactions to myself: “we’re screwed.” After completing the movie it was quite difficult to feel hopeful for our future and be rushed into making small changes in our lives, since how impactful would that really be? If about half of the United States “believes” in this scientific fact, otherwise known as global warming, how will we be able to change the course of our planet? 

  <br><Br>

In one scene, former President Obama was explaining how he hopes his children will still be able to see the ice in Alaska I was wondering to myself if my grandchildren, given Earth is still inhabitable, will think of elephants in a similar way to how my generation views dinosaurs: giant creatures that we can only see in animated films or history books, yet the extinction of elephants will be entirely mankind's fault. Overall, I thought the film served to incorporate the breadth of this crisis and gave me a deeper understanding of the situations in other countries. Devastatingly, the current impacts of global warming are mainly taking a toll on people in lesser developed countries. It seems as if the policy makers of the United States will not wake out of their spell of magical rainbows and utter oblivion until the billionaires are unable to breathe Earth’s air.

I watched An Inconvenient Sequel. This film brought up good points to the problem we are facing, and the climax of the film brought a greatly optimistic feel. The signing of the Paris Agreement was a great and major step towards the defeat of the climate crisis. However, through the film, I did feel discouraged. For example, Gore talks about fossil fuel companies lobbying against solar power, all I could think about was that all of the money they gain by shutting down the solar industry would be useless if the Earth was no longer habitable. I had a similar thought process when the Indian leader declared he would continue to use fossil fuels to power his country because the "US did it for 150 years." I felt that this was not that good of a decision as the whole reason the US is transitioning to renewable energy sources was that they needed to step away from the harmful energy sources they had been using for such a long time. Again, the Indian leader wanted to use fossil fuels to provide energy for the people of his country, but there will no longer be any people to supply energy to if the Earth is no longer habitable. However, I am glad that Al Gore was able to secure a deal between India and SolarCity, pushing the solution agenda forward.
  <br><Br>


A part of the film that upset me was hearing the insertion of Donald Trump's voice recordings, especially with what is going on with the world's political climate today. Trump kept talking about how climate change is a low priority problem, when many scientists have made it clear that it is the most prevalent issue to human existence. He even pulled the U.S. from the Paris agreement, something that many, many countries worked hard to develop and was a really good plan for keeping the world safe for us to live on. He undid so many environmentally-related policies, it seems as if he wants to see the world burn.

  <br><Br>

While Trump has done some atrocious acts against environmental protection, I was glad to see that in Texas, one of the reddest states, there is a large city with a Republican, conservative mayor that reached 90% renewable energy by the time the film was made. I am sure they have reached 100% by now. The very low cost of solar and wind technology that allowed this city to go full renewable energy also gives me hope that eventually, all cities in America can have net-zero carbon emissions. Hopefully, we can see that very soon.

“Before the Flood” takes a great stance on climate change, in that Leonardo DiCaprio was learning about all the consequences alongside the viewers instead of simply spitting out facts for the viewers. It makes it a lot more enjoyable for the viewers and a lot more understandable. This movie, although not very optimistic in regards to the future, does a good job at presenting the facts and presenting them in settings that aren’t as mainstream as others. Being able to see the impacts that climate change is making makes it easier for viewers to process and understand the information given, rather than simply reading an article and learning facts and statistics. 

  <br><Br>

What left me completely appalled was when Leo was in Greenland and the scientist showed him the melted out hose that once was 30 feet deep in ice, but in just 5 short years, now lies on the floor, 30 feet lower than it once was. Physically seeing the effects of carbon emissions is at once devastating but also an incredible wake up call. Palm oil plantations in Indonesia are completely destroying the land, contributing to an unfathomable amount of issues, oil sands in Canada are completely ruining landscapes, and the fact that India and China are both investing more into solar energy than the US is shocking. 

  <br><Br>

It puts a lot into perspective. Places that are contributing the least to climate change are getting hit the hardest with the consequences. The United States is doing an absolutely embarrassing job at paving the way and leading by example, since politics are so prevalent is every environmental policy that tries to pass. Ultimately, nothing can be done without the implementation of climate change policy into government and society. However, in the United States, the government requires agreement by the major parties to pass legislation, but since the majority party in both houses of Congress and the president are never part of the same party and never agree, progress stalls. People need to realize that political parties and climate change are two completely separate issues that shouldn’t be creating such dilemmas. As Leo mentioned in the movie, many Republican politicians are given insane amounts of money from fossil fuel companies, making it impossible for anything to ever move forward. Everyone needs to realize that the time to act is now, political parties aside, because the future as of right now is looking rather grim and we’re running out of time.

 I enjoyed reading your contribution and completely agree with your stance on the film. DiCaprio does an excellent job at educating the public through his first hand encounters at areas directly impacted by climate change. What I admire most about DiCaprio, is that he uses his privilege to make a change. Not only does he make personal lifestyle changes, like going vegan, but he donates a large sum of his income to organizations fighting climate change, and educates the public through his film. The film of course, was depressing, but I think it is striking as it makes people realize the small steps they can take to make a difference and stop contributing to the problem: reducing out consumption of cattle, palm oil products, and reducing our amount of time driving.

I have taken other classes related to climate change, but until watching this video, I did not realize how big of an impact that palm oil industry was making on our environment, and how it was deeply imbedded it was into our lifestyles. 
  <br><Br>

Something that struck me while reading your comment was how you mentioned that we need to put our political parties aside to make any sort of progress. It is honestly astounding that this is even a political issue, when this is literally cold, hard, factual science that cannot be disputed. There is too much CO2 in the air, which is causing our climate to warm at an exacerbated rate. There are no facts to dispute this. But greedy politicians have been able to cherry pick evidence to continue being funded by oil companies and feed us lies that only fuel our overly indulgent lifestyles. I was angry beyond belief when the film was mentioning the corruption in climate change policy. These are people with the money, power and privilege to make drastic positive changes in our carbon emissions!  Yet they are taking all the steps to only further exacerbate the effects of climate change. Like you said, the United States, should be leading by example, but instead we are doing the opposite. It is undoubtedly embarrassing, and infuriating. The irony in this, is that we will likely suffer little to no consequences from climate change, yet we are leaving the world's poor to suffer and deal with the consequences of a problem that we created.

<br><hr>

I completely agree with a lot of those statements. By having Leonardo Decaprio go experience and take in the sights of our planet falling apart, we as the viewer can empathize with him because his reaction mirrors our reaction. From the melting of our ice to the destruction of our forest, Leo was able to give us as the viewer a first hand look at many issues that our changing our world, not just one. It can not be stressed enough how serious the issue is and the short time table we have to turn our actions around.

  <br><Br>


I, like Leo, am extremely pessimistic when it comes to changing in order to preserve our earth. The reason being is that we as a society, especially in the US, are used to our way of life. I think the Indian scientist that Leo talked to was exactly right when saying that US citizens are selfish and are not willing to change when we are the ones producing much of the problems. We in the US produce about a third of the carbon emissions, and with are current political climate, we won’t be cutting back our carbon emissions. There is no excuse for saying that it will change our way of life too drastically when a country like China is producing more, yet doing more to counteract their carbon footprint. They are implementing new technologies to replace those that use more energy and their government is on board with this change. I do not concern myself with the fact that our governments are different, if they can implement change, we in the US have no excuse.

  <br><Br>


Again, I agree that the lack of action from the US is appalling. It has been painstakingly obvious that our government officials are more concerned with the money in their pockets, than actually saving our planet. As the scientist talking to Leo said, big fossil fuels corporations pay officials to discredit climate studies, but the money they make won’t matter if we go extinct with the temperatures rising faster than our bodies can evolve. Our greed as a species is the main cause of the current crisis we are facing since we have to continue to drill and cut down our planet for our comfort. If we can manage to change our habits little by little, we can turn climate change around before we pass the point of no return.

<br><hr>

Like you, I was genuinely astonished by how much the ice in Greenland has receded as of recently. As if thirty feet of melted ice wasn't enough, the fact that this has all happened within the past 5 years is simply incomprehensible! That, on top of the degradation of land for things like palm oil and oil sands, really puts into perspective how large this problem is. Even within our very own country, places like Miami are facing direct consequences of all of this today. 
  <br><Br>
I agree that we need to stop making climate change a matter of political debate. This shouldn't be a Democratic vs. Republican issue, it should be much larger than that . I'm hopeful that activists like Elon are going against the grain and trying to make a change in the way we supply energy. If the two largest emitters, the United States and China, reduce emissions, that will definitely pave the way for other countries to do the same.
<br><hr>
 As you have stated; the melting of the ice sheets in Greenland is very eye-opening. To me, it raises the question of what will the levels be in 2050 when we are well into our life. I believe our generation will be the ones who see the effects of what our ancestors have left us.

I believe that the film “Before the Flood” does a great job of introducing the climate crisis. I enjoyed how the crew of the film took on expeditions around the world and interviewed those who are already being impacted by this change. My initial reaction to Leonardo DiCaprio on a climate change documentary was that he was going to give his opinion on topics that he completely unaware of. As the documentary progressed I realized that he has been heavily involved with this issue over the last decades and has been meeting with political leaders around the world fighting against inaction on this topic.
  <br><Br>
If I could know the truth about the threat of climate change I would want to know. Once I am aware of an issue, I have the opportunity to act on it. Climate change is caused by human activity so of course, I as an individual have a portion of blame to take. I find it saddening that humans are knowingly destroying the Earth and decimating the ecosystem. Americans more than any other nation are to blame for climate change because we are the greatest emitter of greenhouse gases. The United States has become a fossil full addicted country for our economy is greatly reliant on fuels such as gas, coal, and oil. The CO2 released from fossil fuels is the reason for climate change; soon all the ice on the planet will melt and cities will be underwater. 
  <br><Br>
The reason politicians look the other way when it comes to climate change is that they have a corporate interest in fossil fuel money. It works in their favor to divide and confuse the public on this subject. I wish the US could act like China when it comes to this topic. China’s government changed its plan for renewable energy and have decided to prioritize wind and solar over coal.

Unfortunately, anthropogenic climate change has progressed much faster than we can even perceive, and this could be the reason that climate change deniers don’t believe humans are at fault. A concept as complex as climate change is very hard to understand, and the rate at which it is occurring almost feels unreal, and deniers ask,"How can my actions be creating such a huge butterfly effect on the global scales?" As American students, we have the responsibility to act and educate on climate change, as we are the generation most effected by our planets condition.
<br><br>
As one of the most pollutant nations on Earth we must shy away from our ignorance, and acknowledge that we are the problem. The average American produces twenty times as much carbon dioxide as someone from a third world country, and yet no one has acted. These documentaries serve as a  stark reminder that our world is changing rapidly and the only way to stop it is not only a policy change, but a change in culture as well.

Before the Flood
  <br><Br>


While watching Before the Flood, I began to realize even more the extent to which the climate crisis is happening and how fast change will happen if we do not begin to check what we are doing. In the movie, Leonardo DiCaprio went to several different countries to explore the changes already in motion because of the gradual rise of global temperature. For example, China and the Chinese people suffer from a decreasing quality of life due to increasingly bad air quality due to rising levels of pollution. Farther south in Indonesia, forests are being burned and trees are being cut down to produce palm oil, an ingredient present in many everyday commodities. 

  <br><Br>

Another chunk of the movie was dedicated to providing ways we as a human race can try to combat climate change. One of the ways people could begin to combat climate change is by simply changing their diet. As represented by clips in Before the Flood, 47% of land in America is used for food production while 70% of the 47% goes towards growing feed for cattle to make beef. This in turn produces methane, which is even more potent than CO2 in damaging the atmosphere. By cutting down beef consumption, people could do a small action that could go a long way to slow global warming. Another huge way the government could help combat global warming would be by enforcing a carbon tax. The carbon tax would tax any commodity that produces carbon, thus discouraging people from using carbon releasing things. As explained in the video though, the carbon tax would be hard to instate due to the number of climate change deniers in Congress who would prevent such a tax from ever coming to life. In essence, the US government is not doing enough to slow climate change and we the people should be doing more to facilitate change in the government to take action as soon as possible.

I believe celebrities play an important role in society. With social media and the internet as large as it is today, celebrities and influencers are looked up to and idolized by the masses. Take Kylie Jenner, for example, a “self-made” billionaire who has millions of followers on multiple social media platforms, what is she doing with this influence she has? To answer it shortly, she’s posting photos of herself, her nails, her cars, and promoting her company. Girls across the world are now concerned about their looks: the clothes they wear, the makeup they put on, etc. But what these girls should be concerned about is the rest of their lives on the planet. These people who are looked up to by the masses could play an important role in educating people on the issues we face, if they choose to. I don’t mean to put Kylie down in anyway, in fact I truly like her, I just think people with this much influence could be doing more to help the public. This is the case for Leonardo DiCaprio in the film Before the Flood, where he traveled the world in search for the truth about climate change. The director effectively uses ethos in making DiCaprio the protagonist and voice of the film in order to appeal to his audience. Leonardo DiCaprio being the superstar he is played an important role by allowing viewers to trust and be interested in the topic of climate change. The viewers are put into DiCaprio’s shoes as they learn the facts of climate change along with him. 
  <br><Br>

While watching the documentary I’m concerned about climate change decimating ecosystems and transforming the earth’s landscape. Watching DiCaprio tour world witnessing deforestation, water pollution, rising sea levels, coral bleaching, methane emissions, political struggles, people suffering, etc. is alarming. I wondered why more action hasn’t been taken only to find out big companies sway the government to get nothing done. It’s crazy to see how many people are in denial over the existence of climate change. In order to combat climate change, the public needs to be aware of the dangers that face us and accept the truth. Before the Flood, and films like it, give me hope that one day enough awareness will be made and great actions will be taken.

This movie typically targets the global climate change problem from Al Gore's story on working with the climate crisis. Al Gore's presentation seems to be persuasive. He used the scenarios that he truly saw and experienced with statistics, then present to the audience to inform them about the climate. Al Gore's may not be a scientist, but the way how he works with the climate change issues makes him an expert and executant on solving the problem. I feel deeply engaged through his journey from the beginning to the Paris Agreement in 2015.  It was not easy to accomplish this goal. We can say that the scientists and related researchers are the explorers of this area, but he is one put all the actions into reality. Under his efforts, it is not just "one country", it is "countries" that finally comes out into an agreement on reducing the pollution and protecting the earth. 
  <br><Br>


Al Gore has started climate training and expanded it into different countries. Not just the training itself, to me, I can personally feel the change. I live in the States most of the time right now. Before I came to the states in 2016, the air quality is bad and factories are polluting the atmosphere. It was rare to see a blue sky back then. Now, when I go back that it is getting much and much better. The air quality is clear and the sky turns back to blue. I believe that Al Gore's actions are highly effective. What is stunning is that under his negotiation and help, India agreed to convert to renewable energy instead of the traditional fossil fuels which are costly to the environment and humans. 

  <br><Br>

It is not easy for Al Gore to accomplish his goals and it is also not easy for the whole society to suddenly reduce large amounts of pollution. There is still a long way to go on solving the climate crisis and increasing the use of renewable energy worldwide.

Before the Flood and An Inconvenient Sequel
  <br><Br>

After watching the film Before the Flood, I came to realize that there is a large  amount of people that truly care about the climate crisis. Citizens across the world have banded together demanding for some sort of action to be taken place in order to solve the climate crisis. I am very thankful DiCaprio took the role of a climate crisis ambassador because I truly feel we needed someone who is respected by many to come out and side with us climate activists. Throughout the film, DiCaprio talks to many political officials and those with power. This is a great step in the right direction because the political bodies are those who will make the changes in order to help the Earth. Like Elon Musk,  I think a carbon tax should be put on every country in the world. This will make sure each country and its people will limit the consumption of gas, electricity, and anything else that is powered by fossil fuels. Countries a part of the Paris Agreement have only promised to limit their carbon footprints. Although this may be a good step in the right direction, it will definitely not be enough to bring the Earth back under it’s normal cycle. Under this agreement we are still likely to surpass our goal keeping under a 1.5 degree Celsius temperature increase. We also need the United States to take part in the agreement again as we are one of the most powerful and influential countries in the world today. By joining, this may encourage other countries to, making the goal of keeping temperature increase below 1.5 degrees Celsius much more reasonable. Also, people must begin to realize that what they buy and eat as a consumer has a direct and serious effect on the environment. The film highlighted the fact that the beef industry is responsible for most of the greenhouse gas addition into the atmosphere. This is because of these massive farms with thousands of animals on them portrayed in the documentary. Not only is this cruel to the animals, but it is also polluting our freshwater and atmosphere. The easiest way to get rid of these factories is to stop buying the company’s products. On top of that, I appreciate that DiCaprio went to the Amazon Forest to reveal the companies taking out the native trees, and replacing them with palm oil trees. The palm oil trees are not able to hold as much CO2 in them, and therefore more of the greenhouse gas is released back into the atmosphere. In addition to this, wiping the land of native trees also kills off animals living in the Amazon which is horrible. Again, the only way to stop all of this from happening is to stop consuming products that contain palm oil. I am glad The Pope was featured in this documentary because it shows that even religious figureheads are aware of how serious the climate crisis has become. Usually religious figureheads are not willing to recognize scientific reasoning because of their strict beliefs, so to me this showed how real the problem has become, and that it needs to be dealt with now. Through DiCaprio, Greta Thunberg, and other popular activists, the rest of us are able to band together in support of saving the planet. The world’s youth is fighting for change. Now we must get those with political power and say on board to make the decisions for change, in particular the U.S.

Before the Flood talks about Leonardo DiCaprio’s experience during realizing to protect the Earth. He starts the documentary by talking about the painting that shows scenes before the flood. The Earth is over-populated and nearly destroyed. Recent years, there are a lot of parade going on remind people to stop polluting this planet. He mentions the progress of making fossil fuel, that there is not clean fossil fuel. The mind operation is damaging the biosphere. Global warming is becoming a major issue. CO2 emission and climate change are tied together. In order to make the film, Leo and his team have to travel to the south pole to find the real snow. The situation is of course becoming worse. At the sane time, politicians surprisingly do not admit the global warming.
  <br><Br>
Leo travelled to China, India, and many places around the world. On some of the island in the ocean, the sea water is rising fast and almost sunk the island. The coral reef is decreasing compare to it in the past. There are forest fire in drought places. Scientists find out that a healthy diet that contains less beef can reduce contamination on the ecosystem.
  <br><Br>
One thing that get my attention is that some Indian scientists think that the Earth’s situation becoming so bad is American’s fault. Well, India always has an sanitation issues, as showed in the news. India is overpopulated. There are much more citizens than America. The air quality is actually worse than it in California. Thus, I think people should not blame everything on developed country. Instead, disadvantaged places may not have a comparatively comfortable living condition because of the poverty and many other reasons. People should make these places’ living condition better first.

When beginning "Before the Flood", I was very surprised to see Leonardo Di Caprio as the main "protagonist". Maybe I am just out of the loop, but I had no idea he was a climate change activist, and such an important one, at that. But when continuing the documentary, I realized how much sense it made to include him at the forefront. Leonardo Di Caprio is an incredibly well known, relatable actor that appeals to more mainstream audiences, and his knowledge of the climate crisis/interest to broadcast the issues and learn more about them draws in a wider crowd, as people see his name and watch the documentary because they "trust" him. I also enjoyed how he offered simple solutions/changes everyone can make, such as cutting back on beef consumption, and took the time to note, especially about the Palm Oil farms, that it wasn't as easy for consumers to avoid the products, and still offered methods to respect the environment.

  <br><Br>

Seeing the amount of ice that has melted in Greenland, as well as the effects of pollution in China was astounding. I knew the consequences of climate change were bad, but I had never accounted for so much damage so quickly. What strikes me about these events is that people see the headlines and the news about them, but ultimately decide to brush them off and forget because "it doesn't affect them". Ultimately, it IS affecting them, and I really believe people should see the consequences of their actions, firsthand. It's scary to think that worse events are coming. Global food shortages, terrible weather events, and the loss of sacred lands are only going to get worse, and it is scary to see people in power, constantly voting to keep real change at bay in favor of their own pockets. I am sickened by the lack of human compassion.

  <br><Br>

 Although I knew about the media divide, I somehow hadn't realized that it was only created to protect wealthy companies profiting off of making the Earth uninhabitable. It seems like the perfect plan: just keep the public divided, so they can never enact change. The movement in China that actually enacted change definitely inspires hope for me, though. If China, which has surpassed the US in its pollution, can make changes to become more sustainable at the will of its people, why can't the US? The growing environmentalist movement in the US, as it grows and our voices become louder, hopefully will create the same changes as China's movement.

     Thanks for your detailed insight into the film "Before The Flood." I, too, did not know that DiCaprio was such an outspoken climate activist until I saw promos for this film in 2016. I believe that Leonardo throwing his name in the ring will certainly help raise awareness of the climate crisis and its severity. It's also reassuring to see that many more famous people are starting to use their platforms to raise awareness.
  <br><Br>


I also agree with you in how DiCaprio gave us, the viewers, simple and easy ways to reduce our carbon footprint. If everyone could all just adjust their lifestyles a tad bit, we could start to see a positive change in our impact on the planet. 

  <br><Br>

But what I was most intrigued by while watching the film was DiCaprio's discussion of a carbon tax, and his references to a more diabolical plan that corporations are undertaking to ensure maximum profit at the cost of environmental disaster. Aspects inherent in our capitalist society make it hard for companies to place the planet's needs over profits. We as a society must come together to figure this problem out. If we can get corporations to start caring more about the planet that we all share then real change will start to happen.

Before the Flood  <br><Br>

Before I watched this film, I felt that I had a general knowledge about the climate crisis: why it is happening and how to fix it. Now that I have seen the documentary, I realize that what I know is minute in comparison to the facts presented. This film has opened my eyes to the complete depth of this problem and what must be done in order to reverse what has been set in motion. As I learn more and more about the topic at hand, I have become increasingly grateful for the little steps that anyone has consciously taken in order to better our planet. 

  <br><Br>

I will admit that I was a little skeptical when I saw Leonardo DiCaprio as the protagonist, but I was pleasantly surprised with how well he played this role, whether or not he was in fact that knowledgeable about the crisis. His presence along with the appearance of other international celebrities such as Barack Obama, Elon Musk, the Pope, and many others, adds to the credibility of the film. I specifically liked Elon Musk's part about his gigafactory; I had no idea that he had built something with that kind of sustainability power. Another reason I enjoyed this part of the documentary was because it offered a solution that sounded achievable. It gave hope to the viewers which contrasted with the depressing side effects of climate change that were discussed.  

  <br><Br>

I enjoyed the fact that the documentary was not solely focused on America itself, but countries around the world. I felt optimistic when they showed all the alternative energies that some countries, like China, have developed. Unfortunately, it also made me pessimistic about the status of our country and the fact that we have not done something more productive to help this climate crisis; Sunita Narain was correct to be skeptical about the United States and our promises for change. 

  <br><Br>

I would definitely recommend this movie to someone else because I feel as though it has pushed me to be more proactive when it comes to my carbon footprint. It was a well executed movie that everyone should watch and experience.

The film “Before the flood” was surprisingly very intriguing as I clicked on the movie on Netflix I thought I’d be bored w facts but on the contrary I was completely astonished to know what was going on around the world in respect to climate change. DiCaprio did an excellent job of acting as a viewer and asking all the questions that a viewer would tend to have. I was in awe at the vast land that is used for Fracking and how inconsiderate man has become. I was in even more supieses at the fact that the data showing us responsible for all the damage we’ve done to the earth and politicians still believing it’s a hoax for campaign popularity and oil business partnerships. This film truly opened my eyes I watched it all night never once was I distracted because the film kept me educated every single time . It seems that we are set for our doom in the decades to come but their is still hope according to the ex-NASA scientist and because of that I will better myself in protecting this planet and will advocate for others as well.

I agree with your statement about the feeling of astonishment when discovering the efforts of other countries against climate change versus the United States'. It's surprising and extremely disappointing to see how much the US consumes in terms of energy compared to other countries like India. It kind of makes me think of just how privileged ignorant, and complacent many Americans are. Being such a dominant country, I feel that if the US could increase our efforts against climate change, it will in turn also inspire many other countries to do the same.
  <br><Br>

In addition, I also think DiCaprio did a great job of being able to produce a movie that can get across to various people with all sorts of backgrounds. I think his choice of featured figures was excellent as it helped increased the authority and credibility of his film. This film is really an eye opener and it shows just how little the average person knows about climate change and how layered it really is. 
  <br><Br>
Since there still is hope, I  hope that more people come across this film and watch it because it encompasses the stress humans have been putting on our planet.

The Film Before the Flood made a bigger picture of climate change of fossil fuels are affecting the whole planet. In this documentary, we are able to see different places around the earth with Leonardo Dicaprio. These specific places show Dicaprio and the viewers some places that are trying to improve climate change by using renewable resources such as solar panels and wind power. We were also shown some areas that are affected by climate change such as Greenland,  oceans, and Indonesia. Countries and areas of ice are melting at an alarming pace which can cause sea levels to rise. Oceans are also being affected by fossil fuels because of coral reefs dying from the carbon which can cause ocean species to become extinct. Lastly, the forest fires caused by climate change cause animals to die and co2 levels to rise significantly. 

  <br><Br>

But, the documentary made me very mad when all of these people denying the effects of fossil fuels around the world. All these people want money and power which I still do not understand. It's like the Lorax, The Onceeler keeps cutting down trees until the last one drops. There is no money to gain and the air is in bad shape because there is nothing to take in the co2 and produce oxygen. This is the same for fossil fuels. These people will keep producing and looking for fossil fuels until the last drop is found. Once it is all gone, it's too late for the world to recover and now they have nothing to gain from it. People have to stop trying to gain power and wealth and care more for humanity. When it's too late, you can't go back without huge punishments and regrets.

After watching "Before the Flood" I was amazed at how much this world had changed over time as a cause of human pollution. One part that really stood out to me was when DiCaprio was looking at the weather station and the researcher explained that the 30ft of tubings had once been under ice and after 5 years, it had all melted away. This really opened my eyes up to how much our ice shelves are melting away, contributing to sea level rise. I could not believe how many politicians in the US did not believe that climate change was occurring and that they openly denied it. This can be said also about certain news outlets, whose anchors also adamantly opposed the idea of climate change. The film really brought to light how much politicians are controlled by big corporations across the political landscape in order to meet their needs. All the big oil corporations make the biggest contributions and I find it crazy that heads of environmental committees are doing nothing to help because of this. Another startling part of the film was when the scientist had talked about how he posted the graph showing climate change and how many people came after him from politicians to news outlets to even receiving death threats. This showed just how much people don't want to look at the situation at hand and face it head on. I was interest how the film used an actor for the film instead of a scientist, but in my mind it created a better way for people to relate to because he was someone that has appeared in films worldwide and is well recognized, rather than using some random scientist that no one had heard of before.

I found the film “Before the Flood” very interesting and eye opening. There is a multitude of evidence showing that the earth's climate is changing and that these changes are being driven by humans. This film did a great job of showing the many facets of climate change. There are so many different variables in play that contribute to climate change. A massive one that really left me frustrated is how politicized this issue is. The way corporations are paying off representatives to spew climate change denial is really disheartening to see. For instance, the film talked about how Florida is one of the more vulnerable places to rising sea levels yet regardless of this, Florida Republicans, namely Rick Scott, has refused to even say the phrase “climate change,” let alone acknowledge it. Apparently he barred state officials from even mentioning the phrase in official correspondence. The fact this problem has become such a huge partisan issue has only made tackling the problem even harder.

  <br><Br>

Another consequence of climate change that stuck out to me while watching the film was learning about how the islands in the Pacifc Ocean. It really is terrible that the communities who contribute the least to climate change will suffer the worst consequences from it.

I agree with your praise of the film, the producers to an admirable job capturing the complexity of the issue our planet faces and motivating the audience to be both aware of the impacts of their own actions and outspoken about what they want their governments to do about it. Additionally, the content is presented in a format (following DiCaprio around the world) that makes it especially engaging and immersive. 

<br><br>
Similar to yourself, I also appreciated the vast amount of evidence and sources the film called upon to support its position. The team behind this film traveled everywhere, from arctic glaciers to coral reefs. And DiCaprio sat down with a variety of credible figures including politicians, entrepreneurs, and climatologists. I think this approach made the film appear trustworthy and its message additionally persuasive. I would be interested to see how someone less informed or even in denial about climate change would react to this film.
<br><hr>
I agree that the political aspect of the climate crisis is troubling. Those who are in support of the idea of/the imminent danger of climate change are usually quite vocal about it, and that's always helpful. What's sad is how many people and politicians still refuse to believe in or acknowledge it, despite all of the scientific evidence supporting the issue. The part in the film where Leonardo DiCaprio is interviewing President Obama after the Paris Climate Agreement, and DiCaprio is asking if whoever comes into office next could take apart everything he worked for to combat climate change was hard to watch. Trump pulling out of the climate agreement was a sad day for the United States. The truth is that we have been the leading contributor to greenhouse gas emission for a long time, and yet this film made me think we're doing some of the least work to combat it. I think the reasoning behind why we're so negligent to the idea of climate change is due to the fact that we don't experience the impacts in day to day life. China has been fast to take steps to reduce their pollution because they're struggling to breath in day to day life. Despite the fact that they are producers for most of the Western world, they're still taking large strides, which is something the U. S. could follow in. 

<br><br>

When it comes to the fact that the poorest parts of the world are the most impacted by climate change and contribute the least to it is simply heartbreaking. It's the harsh reality that the U. S. has a lifestyle standard that is far above almost everywhere else in the world, and it is sadly supported by an immense amount of fossil fuel production. The part in the movie when they are in India and the woman is talking about how the U. S. needs a lifestyle change was something I hadn't thought about before. Growing up in America, it hadn't really crossed my mind that our way of life could be so negatively impacting the environment, but it clearly is. An overarching lifestyle change for the country does seem like a stretch, but not something entirely impossible, and maybe something some people could move towards in the future as efforts to reduce climate change garner more and more support.
<br><hr>

I share your frustration in the politicization of the climate crisis. It is extremely selfish that corporations and politicians will try to discredit the severity of our environment’s condition at the expense of not only the reputations of devoted climate scientists, but ultimately of our entire planet. Corporations know that drastic measures taken for the sake of our planet will force them to reduce their carbon emissions; if reducing carbon emissions means reducing their profit, they want no part of it. Not to sound overly dramatic, but making a profit won’t be very easy if the Earth becomes uninhabitable.  
<br><br>


In the film, climatologist Michael E. Mann details being attacked by congressman and other big names for his “hockey stick” graph revealing an increase in global warming. The fact that people in power are willing to drag people like Mann down shows that they have no problem dragging the rest of the population down with them. If we as a country don’t break out from the grips of big business, climate change will continue to be an issue pushed away from our minds until it’s too late to deal with it.

Beginning with the film "Before the Flood", starring renowned actor Leonardo DiCaprio, I feel his approach to the vast topic of climate change as a major global threat resonates with many due to his appeal to the general audience. His popularity as an actor creates a nonthreatening, non-intimidating, recognizable image; a figurehead that is easy to follow. DiCaprio chooses to approach this film as if he is learning about many of the Earthly devastations for the first time, a character trait that he purposefully exacerbates to make himself more relatable to everyday people; the documentary being on Netflix, paired with the notable reputation of DiCaprio himself in the Hollywood context, attracts a different type of viewer, one that may not necessarily be deeply educated on the topic at hand. DiCaprio acts as a guide, one equally knowledgeable as the viewer on their couch, therefore evoking in them similar emotions of shock, devastation, guilt, and most importantly, introspection. In my opinion, acting as a surrogate is a largely successful rhetoric device. As the viewer and DiCaprio seemingly embark on this hour and a half long journey together, the message of urgency DiCaprio conveys can be more easily received. However, some crucial pills are more difficult to swallow: the complacency and corruption of government systems, the ignorance of developed countries regarding developing countries, the poor example the Western world is setting, the track humanity has paved for itself. I personally found great value in the film, particularly the interview with Sunita Narain regarding the negligence and exploitative predomination of Western society, particularly the United States. I also found the extensive destruction of Indonesian forests intriguing as well as mortifying.

<br><br>

The alternate film, "An Inconvenient Sequel", featuring former United States Vice President Al Gore, attempts to capture the breadth of the climate crisis message with an entirely different approach. The main focus is Al Gore, and great emphasis is placed upon his reputation as former man of immense power. The international conferences and trainings spearheaded by Gore are repeatedly highlighted throughout the film, a choice that augments his credibility as an environmentalist and activist. His unique position as a high-ranking government official offers a new political perspective to the climate emergency; I found the challenge of approaching climate related topics within the government to “non-believing” officials extremely relevant, though infuriating.

<br><br>

Rather than becoming one with and relating to the people as DiCaprio does, Gore instead serves as a leader to them, one who can be the tip of the spear in the climate crisis movement. Though despite their efforts, the receival of the message is not one of uproarious disbelief and immediate action. I think this is because people don’t want to hear that they’re wrong or that what they’re doing is wrong. They don’t want to hear that from the places they shop, to the officials they elect, to the food they put into their bodies, they are ignorantly perpetuating the collapse of the natural world and ultimately humanity itself. To admit error and change is substantially more difficult than justifying current behavior. When posed with the question, “If you could know the truth about the threat of climate change, would you want to know?”, I think many would say yes, hence why many have watched these documentaries. Regrettably, I do not think many would do, or have done, much about it. Therefore, analyzing the various message deliverance methods is of the utmost importance; in order to create mass systemic change, the masses must be involved. There is a need to find a way to alarm, guilt, or otherwise inspire people to action, and while I don’t think either documentary was completely successful in doing so, they are positive steps in the right direction.

“If you could know the truth about the threat of climate change, would you want to know?” This is the question asked by professor Hiltner at the beginning of the lecture video on the film Before The Flood, and it is exactly the question that this film addresses. Starring Academy Best Actor Leonardo DiCaprio who was appointed by the UN Secretary-General as the UN Climate Ambassador, Before the Flood displays DiCaprio’s journey set out to different places in the world to learn about the anthropogenic nature, the devastating impacts, and the possible practical solutions to climate change along with us, the audience. 
<br><br>

This film was really an eye-opening experience for me because it inspired me to look at the issue of climate change in a new light, now that this film showed me the true, real negative consequences of climate change that are currently taking place in several places in the world. Climate change was not as far-away or high-reaching or even unrealistic as some people, such as the deniers of climate change, are insisting; instead, it is a current, urgent, pressing problem that looms over the planet and is still destroying our environment and leaving horrific traces behind at an astonishingly fast pace. 
<br><br>

I was able to visually experience the true, occurring impacts of climate change on the planet through the film: the long pole measuring the amount of ice that had melted in the past five years in the Arctic region; the unpredictable extreme weather patterns that are becoming a norm recently as extreme weather events become more frequent, such as the unusual rainstorms in India that had inundated the field and killed farmers’ crops; the problem of ocean acidification as the ocean water grows increasingly acidic from all the carbon dioxide it had absorbed from the atmosphere, thus directly leading to the death and perishing of coral reefs, which are crucial components in maintaining the balance of the marine ecosystems; the deteriorating air quality and the formation of city smog in places like Beijing, China that took on a major toll on the health of the citizens and causing many respiratory diseases. All of the situations stated above are related to climate change, and we cannot blame anyone for the occurrence of these circumstances because we humans are the primary culprits for climate change and we should take on the responsibility of handling the horrendous consequences of climate change. 
<br><br>

Going back to the question professor Hiltner asked at the beginning of the film lecture video, and I think I have an answer to it now that I have finished watching the documentary film. My answer is yes because I truly want to know the impacts of climate change and how it is inevitably transforming our planet. Having knowledge of the consequences of climate change would equip me with the necessary mindset and skills to contribute my efforts to save our environment. The reason is that I have seen what climate change is doing to our beautiful planet, and we humans are the only ones who are held accountable and are able to stop climate change from its further destruction. Also, I think that this film, along with other environmental documentaries related to climate change, has done a wonderful job at educating its audience, who are primarily ordinary citizens who do not know much about climate change and its impacts and evoking a strong emotional response from the audience that they feel this sense of responsibility shared by the entire mankind to take actions to save the environment. 
<br><br>

If I were to rate this film, I would give it a five out of five, and I would definitely recommend it to others to watch and learn some more about climate change that they have never thought about before. The film takes on an expository approach to address the impacts of climate change, which is very effective because people will only take actions and voluntarily act to contribute to the efforts to save the planet having the exposure to the true, unfiltered, realistic, real-time impacts of climate change on the environment. 
<br><br>

We cannot solve the issue of climate change if we cannot even directly face and acknowledge its existence and consequences; the first step to solving climate change is to recognize its presence and face its impacts head-on, and Before The Flood, along with other environmental films, have successfully achieved this objective. Now the power and decision are lying in the hands of us, humans, and it is up to us to decide the next course of action to tackle climate change. The future of our planet really lies within us.

I completely agree with you in the fact that this documentary truly showed - not told - the realities of climate change within this day and age, along with the ramifications that it can hold if we take inaction rather than action. The ability of the documentary to not only tell us the facts and figures of the current climate crisis, but to also allow the audience to visually experience the effects that climate change has already had on our planet, and will continue to have, helps to make a very compelling case that will eventually persuade people to save the planet. One aspect of your comment that I really enjoyed is the lack of acknowledgment that people and states may have towards this issue. And I do not even mean to bring up the idea that people simply do not believe in climate change or that climate change is a political scheme by far-left politicians to create fear and propaganda against the general public. Rather, the acknowledgment that I think is significant is the realization of who is hurting the planet the most because the nations that take the first step are the ones that are creating the most harm. If larger, more developed nations take this initial step, then it creates a precedent and example for other countries to do the same. Just as Sunita Narain said, the United States needs to “put their money where their mouth is,” and she is exactly right.

Film Comment: After watching the movie Before the Flood I felt Leonardo DiCaprio and his team effectively addressed the realities of climate change and backed it with scientific evidence and interviews which for me was very convincing and credible. DiCaprio showed how humans are exponentially increasing the process of global warming and how at our current rate we are spiraling towards an endless list of repercussions. I felt the way in which he portrayed how humans are polluting the environment and then direct effects of that pollution and its global warming effect in places like Greenland is very effective at convincing viewers climate change is a real and current issue. The reason why is it gives physical and almost shocking images that these things are happening like ice sheets melting, forests burning and the rest of the natural world reacting which relates to viewers emotionally and logically that we need to create a solution and take action now since it is happening in front of you and can't hide.  DiCaprio also in the movie carries a genuine and authentic passion for the environment and wants to preserve it which for me was contagious and made me want to help. One thing I liked in particular too about the movie is how DiCaprio addressed how while the earth warms and temperatures are going to rise the earth is going to get really cold in some regions from the cold ice water melting that's slowing the AMOC and its circulation of warm ocean waters. Most people don't know that not only is the Earth going to experience warming if we don't take action but it'll also drop in temperature for some places where it'll be freezing. Overall though I really enjoyed the film and was surprised by how many parts of climate change they were effectively able to cover while also making it a movie that draws you in and makes you see how huge of a problem we have and the actual urgency of it.

Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Al Gore are not climate scientists and don’t have any actual education in the matter, however, they’ve proven to be prominent climate activists. Through each film, we get to walk alongside DiCaprio and Gore separately to see what it’s like navigating the ups and downs of their work in the climate crisis. Both films can be pessimistic just because of the sheer severity of the matter, but I felt that Before the Flood was more saddening and less motivating. The audience got to learn about aspects of climate change as DiCaprio learned them, which made the weight feel heavier. Gore, on the other hand, employed a sense of confidence because of his years of experience in climate activism and politics. An Inconvenient Sequel highlighted Gore’s history in this area and being that I was unfamiliar with his work prior to this class, I was moved by his passion and unapologetic activism. In the film Gore said, “anybody who decides to be a part of helping to solve the climate crisis has a constant struggle between hope and despair” and then he continued to motivate his audience and celebrate climate successes that have recently happened like Scotland getting 100% of their electricity from wind one day. Gore’s optimism is contagious and inspiring and because of this, I think it’s a good film to watch after Before the Flood once you have basic knowledge about the climate crisis.

Film(before the flood): This film was really eye opening for me. It was particularly interesting to see the people attacking DiCaprio for voicing what he had learned about the climate crisis. I was not necessarily shocked by this, as someone who lives with someone who does not believe in climate change i have no lack of exposure to the commentary by those who value the benefits of fossil fuel exploitation and harmful lifestyles  more than scientific fact. It was, however, perplexing to see someone of great influence in the position i have found myself with my father many times. Typically, celebrities can spew garbage about fad diets, fancy cars, and over priced clothing to be regurgitated instantaneously by any impressionable teen that just so happens to be listening. The reaction DiCaprio receives is certainly not the blind adherence that the general public usually pays its idolized elite. This strikes me because it points out a fundamental problem regarding public awareness to the climate crisis and society in general: we are willing to follow blindly to promises of unrealistic measure so long as they provide a favorable outcome. When someone in the same position as DiCaprio assures popularity and success, the means do not need to be realistic or even fathomable in order to be received well, however, if they propose sacrifice for the greater good the illusion of the american dream which they represent is shattered. People ultimately want to live the lavish and work free life that celebrities represent, that is, after all, what makes us pay them millions of dollars to perform for us on and off the stage. Additionally, it is only after they say something we do not like that we begin to question the validity of the celebrity voice; then we begin to cite their ridiculous propositions of how to obtain success to discredit their genuine beliefs.  This is my major problem with Before the Flood. By choosing DiCaprio the fourth wall is shattered, we see DiCaprio as a real person, worried about real things. Contrary to most of the comments in which my peers said this detail made them feel more connected to the subject, i think that when we see a huge celebrity in a serious documentary we immediately detach from the problem at hand. In today's times, famous and fiction go hand and hand. Thus, i felt this particular documentary, while eye opening and extremely interesting, does a poor job of conveying the seriousness of the climate crisis. Similar to The Uninhabitable Earth, it attempts to reach its viewers utilizing extreme eye catching tactics while subsequently undermining their ultimate goal. As Ken points out, the consequences of climate change are not something which we will feel at its extreme until it is too late to change, thus, the conversation about the climate crisis needs to change. If we are to succeed in changing our actions, the participation of all individuals is necessary. The only way to even hope to achieve this is to stop antics that appeal to those easily convinced and shift the tone of the climate change conversation to be far more real.

I agree with your opinion. Like you, I have lived with people who do not believe in climate change either so Dicaprio's reaction shocked me.

Before the Flood: I watched this film with my roommates and within the first ten minutes we were all completely absorbed in it. The broad spectrum of topics that the film covered were all reflective of the facts in the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" and presented those facts visually to really be able to get people to recognize the seriousness of the effects of climate change. Watching the melting ice caps in the Arctic was deeply saddening and hearing them say that by 2040 we will be able to sail across the North Pole is utterly depressing and really serves as a reminder of how imminent the drastic effects of climate change and the melting of polar ice caps are. We just started the new decade and now in only 20 years the polar ice caps will be melted, that is going to cause serious implications for the majority of the world's population who lives along the coast. As a Los Angeles native it is hard to hear that my home has the serious potential of being underwater like many other cities including Miami, as mentioned in the film. The effects seen in India were heartbreaking as farmers' crops were destroyed due to an unseasonal rainfall that flooded the crops with half a year's rainfall in the span of 5 hours. The effects are very real and taking tolls on people's lives even if they are not being broadcast on mainstream media. That represents the very principle that the poor and vulnerable are the first ones affected by climate change and it threatens their livelihood. 
  <br><br>

The consequences of climate change are becoming more of a reality everyday as the world is not taking immediate action to combat it. I applaud Leonardo DiCaprio for standing up for the environment and the work he does to bring awareness. I have seen the attacks on him and those in his position that use their platform to bring awareness to issues and it's disheartening to hear people shut him down as if he can't have a voice the same as any of us, especially as he has worked to educate himself. If he has the platform he should be able to use it for good which is what he is doing as the UN Ambassador. The most disheartening aspect of the video that I was thinking about after it finished was how it didn't age well in the time span from when it was filmed to when I watched it. They were all so hopeful about the promises from the Paris Climate Agreement and truly believed that it would bring upon a positive change for the future. Seeing Obama brought upon a sense of wistfulness as there was hope for the climate with him as president and agreeing to the Paris Climate, juxtaposed to Trump pulling out of the agreement. Seeing the clips of Trump and all the other Republicans denying climate change angered me as I thought of how his presidency has put such an emphasis on fossil fuels, putting us in the complete opposite direction we need to be in. The film truly did teach me a lot and leave a lasting message in my brain through all the visuals so I want to start moving my diet to a plant based diet. I loved the film, as did all my roommates, and I think it is something that everyone should watch as a start to educate themselves on the climate crisis.

I thought the film Before the Flood was well done. I like that Leonardo DiCaprio was a part of it because it provided helpful point of view. I think seeing an actor that did not have much prior knowledge or a degree in science was useful in letting the audience know that anyone can create positive change. I like the way the painting was used as a metaphor in the film because it really helped me to understand how crucial the problem has become. The visuals really helped as well as other people talking about the science behind it because it provided credible information. 
  <br><br>

I was devastated at watching how badly we are treating the planet but it is important to see and acknowledge. Before the film the only other ways I saw the impact of a natural disaster was through social media and it was not many times. This movie provides visuals that are moving and made me want to live a life that will create positive change. 
  <br><br>

I think the the people interviewed was well put together because they varied. It provided a full scope of people that are either helping or affected by climate change. Again, I am not fully aware of the damage caused by climate change but watching this film provided me visuals and facts that have taught me that only because I am not being directly impacted by natural disasters (yet) it is occurring in other places and very true.

<p>
The persona that Leonardo Di Caprio takes in "Before The Flood" is a great rhetorical device for the standard viewer. It allows the viewer to relate to a popular figure by the similar traits they both exhibit, the lack of knowledge one has about climate change. It is a powerful tool to gain capital in the currency of belief. Otherwise, one may find themselves farther from the issue by not having someone to relate to. 
  <br><br>

The film itself is a great tool to educate the standard viewer of the global implications of climate change. It demonstrated the amount of effort that is going into the movement but also the lack of action that is being taken by some country's governments. As of now, the United States has backed out of the Paris Climate Accord, which is ironic given the statement Leonardo had made about the agreement being solely on faith. It goes to show the lack of commitment the accord actually had backing it. To really initiate a global paradigm shift on climate change, the most industrialized nations will have to take that initial step forward. 
  <br><br>

In response to that, the typical line of thinking regarding change within a country relies on the amount of resources available to advance to a green-based infrastructure. Since the largest three polluters are also the largest industrialized nations it would be hypocritical to condemn other nations who also pollute the environment; they clearly don't have the resources in place to make that change. It is almost impossible to develop a nation without abusing natural resources, so either the developed nations will have to turn a blind-eye to pre-industrial countries or continuously aid them in their progress to developing green-based infrastructure.
  <br><br>

The one thing I especially took notice of within the film was the plan that an individual could uptake immediately to contribute towards the movement; shifting their diet. It was the most plausible solution towards climate change at the individual level. If eight billion took part in this change, then the world would experience a vast change in food consumption and lessen the environmental strain on the planet.

I found the film to be truly impacting on the climate change issue.  Leonardo DiCaprio serves as someone to look up to in his efforts to try and learn more about the issue.  It was quite unbelievable to see how the United States is mostly centered on denying that there is a real problem with climate change and global warming.  DiCaprio is admirable for admitting that the more he learned about climate change, the more he realized how much information he does not yet know.  His efforts to learn more about the pressing issue serves as an example to the rest of the American people that this problem is only one that will continue to grow if changes aren't made.  I was somewhat surprised to see how our current president, Donald Trump, ridiculed the issue.  A clip of Trump is shown in the film where he goes on to say that the temperature has been extremely cold, which means global warming must not be occurring.  I found the contrast between the mindset of DiCaprio, a Hollywood actor, and Trump, the United States president to be shocking.

<p>
Did they pick the wrong guy? Leonardo DiCaprio is the environmentalist messenger for United Nations and narrator of the film. At the beginning of the documentary I doubted why this movie star was the lead for such an influential documentary. By the middle of the documentary, I was convinced by his credibility and more apprehensive about climate change than ever before. By the end of the documentary, I'm persuaded to become an environmentalist. 
  <br><br>

This documentary is so effective because of the visuals and imagery of different landscapes. Logos stirs up the viewers by clips like ice walls breaking off of glaciers and the lifeless oil drill sites of Shell and Exxon. Pathos appeals to the emotions of the audience by the adorable forest animals. These animals are threatened and their homes are being destroyed. Is human life valued higher than the rest of the life on Earth? 
  <br><br>

What shocks me is the misinformation and diffusion of responsibility from the companies burning fossil fuels. Monopolized industrial companies lead us astray by ruining the Earth for the short term monetary profit of the few. The corruption in politics by the politicians receiving the most wealth compensation try to divide the country and slow the movement against global warming. This allows the industrialization to continue everyday and do more damage before everyone can unite. 
  <br><br>

I was unaware of the renewable energy substitution. No wonder America is slow in conversion and the worst country at conserving energy. We are getting showed up by Asia who is smartly and rapidly making changes when we are being selfish. In Mr. DiCaprio's interview in India, the women powerfully preached "you are a fossil fuel addicted country. It is not a pigment of your imagination." The United States is comprised of over-producers and over-consumers. 
  <br><br>

Mr. DiCaprio's speech concluding the documentary is a perfect call to action that gives you chills and wakes up the ignorant to be better for the sake of our children and our children's children. This moving picture tries to tackle the climate crisis by raising awareness of its existence, showing the monstrosities in our near future, and gives us the call to action to prevent it. The visuals and imagery leaves you in awe and gives much needed perspective and inclusiveness showcasing all the negative effects to our planet. This documentary is effective by its ethos or credibility and persuasiveness hitting the human condition. 


A couple home-run messages and facts that I learned and stuck with me are the following :
  <br><br>
Will 100 GigaFactories  and the Carbon Tax Shift solve the world's problems ?
  <br><br>
Convince the people and politicians will fall in line very quickly 
  <br><br>
Wind and solar energy is forever and our best substitution 
  <br><br>
Sweden first fossil fuel free nation
  <br><br>
Indisputable science vs hope 
  <br><br>
The Garden of Earthly Delights metaphor is impressive because it was painted so long ago and predicted the problems of today. 
  <br><br>
I would be interested in watching the two inconvenient documentaries to get more perspectives and see how other directors tackle climate change.

I thought the Revenant was an amazing movie. To me, it seemed like a very deep movie that vividly depicted man's struggle against the elements. Not once did I think about the movie from the lens of climate change and habitat decimation. It is amazing how I missed that key element of the movie. I mean now that I am reflecting on it several years later, it seems absolutely obvious. Parallelly, I thought I was well informed on the subject of Climate change. As a firm believer of global warming and an islander, I have both witnessed firsthand some of the issues presented and researched the topic independently. However, Before the Flood really put everything into perspective for me. The scene of the climate station with the exposed hose was honestly one of the most powerful images of climate change I have ever seen. Not only was it absolutely terrifying as I never imagined that that much ice had already melted. I mean, one thing is to read about it and another is to see it in film. What was ice as far as the eyed could see, several stories high... gone. It is simply astonishing. I find it kind of ironic that this problem that we have created is so bad that it is outpacing our attempts to study it. 

  <br><br>

Other images that really resonated with me were those of the palm oil. I was aware of the issue and tried to switch to alternatives such as naturally sourced coconut oil, but I had no idea that simple things like Doritos contained vegetable oil. Seeing the scale of corruption in our food industry was mind-boggling. Furthermore, seeing the aerial shots where the palm trees vastly surpassed the amount of rainforest was depressing, especially coming from a tropical island. As a late new year's resolution, I have decided to be more conscious of my food choices, especially how I snack. I am already working on progressing towards a Mediterranean diet and will try my best to switch my snacks to more fruits and nuts. 

  <br><br>

Another area that hit close to home for me was that of snow. To me, snow is somewhat magical. I associate it with holidays, good times and family. Snowboarding and snow hiking are my favorite sports. The fact that my future children may grow up without it is simply sad. It made me think about all the things I take for granted that may not be around for the next generation. It made me think of all the stuff that we have already lost even during my short lifetime, such as the vivid coral reefs I used to snorkel just five years ago.

I have seen this film before in high school and watching this film again raised my anxiety relating to climate change. Leonardo DiCaprio really did go all over the world to share about climate change. This film would have to be my favorite so far, with it being able to truly show so many different aspects of this topic. This film would be more likely to watch than other films on this issue due to how well known Leonardo DiCaprio is. It is crazy how in one film, Leonardo was able to have a personal conversation with the US president, the Pope, and the UN Secretary General.
  <br><br>
The part of the film that frighten me the most was how it was shared that Greenland and the arctic was on track to melt entirely. It seems impossible to fix this once it starts. Once it starts melting completely, it will completely alter the world’s weather patterns. It was interesting how this film shows the perspective of Indians also being part of increasing the problem of man-made climate change in the future. They need to skip the industrializing process and jump straight into using sustainable energy. I was surprised to see how although China is the world’s biggest polluter, it also invests the most in sustainable energy. It is encouraging to see that there are actually influential people who care about helping the environment. I hope there are other people like Elon Musk who are looking for ways to have factories of sustainable energy.
  <br><br>
This film was the first to make me feel more hopeful rather than angry after watching it. This film was able to give more practical ways to help with climate change such as eating less read meat, not buying products with palm oil, and voting for people who support climate action.

<p>
After watching "Before the Flood", I was not prepared for that wake-up call at all. It is truly shocking to know that the film was made almost 4 years ago. The disastrous scenes and effects that were presented were already terrifying and knowing that we have barely made any changes since is horrifying. We are now living in 2020 where climate change was gain more awareness yet no serious politically actions have been made in the 4 years since the Paris Agreement. It's sad and quite frustrating. After watching this documentary, I realized that a lot of people say that people need to start making changes, little or big. But I feel like even if one person made a change in their life, their diet, or their habits, it seems like it's not making any impact because it truly is up to our world leaders to do something about it. How do you expect one person who is a normal civilian to make a change yet you also have celebrities who are taking private jets because they want to. It's not up to those who are struggling to make ends meet in society, it's those with the resources who are able to make the change. It's those who are in power to make the change. It's those whose carbon footprint equals 10 people to make the change. It's the celebrities, the billionaires, and those in power who need to contribute to fighting climate change because they can yet they choose not to. People would really sacrifice this earth for luxury and it is absolutely a smack in the face for those who are simply trying to survive. 

  <br><br>

I think they chose Leonardo DiCaprio because of his role in social media. Yes, he's not a scientist. Yes, he doesn't have a degree specializing in the environment, etc, but it is his image. He is famously known in Hollywood, thus has a big following. If you see someone who you admire do something, you'll want to do it too. This is also an issue I see in our economy. If our world leaders aren't doing anything to fight climate change, why should we? It's that exact mentality that will direct us towards hopelessness. I believe that countries need to get together and focus on a solution economically and politically. They are the ones that will be the driving force. You can scream and yell about climate change, but you cannot force people to do something they don't want to do. But if you can influence people to do the right thing through actions. Don't just talk about it, be about it. And I think that's what Leonardo is trying to say during his speech in New York. This documentary is very influential and showed me the world's past, present and possible future.

<p>
I have watched both an Inconvenient Sequel and Before The Flood before. I chose to watch An Inconvenient Sequel again because I really admire Al Gore. I think his work within politics has helped shaped the way world leaders think about the climate crisis and that his persistence has brought about real change. As a political science major, I like how the politics of this complex issue was brought into light throughout the film. I think that Gore brought up an important issue when he talked about the climate crisis in terms of how it will affect democracy. With each natural disaster that hits this country (and others) there is growing concern that governments will be unable to support their constituents financially. 
  <br><br>
I think that this concern is very real and very right to have. The climate crisis will create tensions within the international stage and increase the already high stress placed on domestic policymakers. However, I think we as voters can help this issue by utilizing our rights to vote, petition and protest those in power who are no longer listening to the people. We also need to continue to empower those in power that are in touch with voters and that does stay true to their constituents so that they continue to. If we can do this, we can uphold our democratic values and shape the system to manage the crisis at hand.

After watching the documentary “Before the Flood”, I am quite convinced that the biggest contributor to climate change is not fossil fuels or cow farts, but of human ignorance and greed. Major fossil fuels companies have not only monopolized their products but they also fund and lobby for politicians and lawmakers to literally work for them, blocking out bills that are beneficial for the planet in order to preserve their business. As the leader of the free world, the United States is a shining example of what every country should strive for, yet even though it preaches for conservation, laws like the carbon tax aren’t implemented. Obama wasn’t able to do it because of the fossil fuel industry lobbyists, and this was probably why the Parris Climate Summit did not take major steps either: the people do not view it as necessary. Yes, there are now youth movements that are stepping up into the play, but if conservative lawmakers keep blocking bills, nothing will get done. It is because of this ignorance and greed that will lead to the downfall of humanity as we know it.

Miami's solution to its problems considering the flooding did not seem selfish to me. It was the only logical thing that they could do. With congress at the time filled with Deniers, there was no way that they could ask for a wider change, and even with their solution of building pumps that are critical to the city's existence, people weren't too happy when they realized that they had to pay more taxes. Humans are just terrible, and I guess we are getting what we deserve.

I agree with your statement that the leading cause of climate change is human ignorance and greed. Hearing the part in the movie that showed how American politicians are lobbying and even buying out scientists and other people of high stature just to make it seem as if their money interests aren't critically damaging the earth was quite hard to hear. Fossil fuel corporations have become so large and bloated in the sense that they can now easily manipulate the government and its citizens with the money they gained from pillaging the environment. What Sunita Narain was explaining to DeCaprio in the film is crucial to us Americans to understand. If the U.S. political landscape pushed for a more clean energy agenda rather than tripping over the fact that money is lost from their pockets, a change that will be heard around the world would be in effect. Instead the U.S. is a fossil fuel addicted nation that fails to use its largely available wealth and brain power to help create cheaper and more efficient clean energy.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your statement about greed and selfishness being the leading factor to climate change. I ultimately believe that the corruption within American politics creates a major obstacle for effective and progressive climate action. I like to think of democracy and the environment to both be extremely fragile. American politics are guilty of environmental degradation in pursuit for economic gain for the fossil fuel industry. We see this in the documentary as Leonardo Di Caprio travels across the US to visit such locations that are subject to this type of environmental destruction. The documentary also mentions how the United States has been the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, suggesting the US to be “fossil fuel addicted.” Which coincidentally coincides to the ‘beliefs’ of many of our leaders in congress, who are lobbied by these industries. Climate denial among political elites creates great controversy within society and progressive action for climate change. It is frustrating that our democracy is manipulated by the powerful industries within our country rather than the voice of the people. It is also upsetting to see the United States, as suggested by you, “a leader of the free world,” to be such a poor example. I believe if money was taken out of politics, we would be able to progressively combat climate change. Unfortunately, I think taking money out of politics is easier said than done because of how corrupt our political system is

Before the Flood and Leonardo DiCaprio’s voyage around the world in search of the truth behind climate change was incredibly insightful and informative. I enjoyed DiCaprio’s narration and appreciated his clear concern for the issue. I also respected the fact that he acknowledged his lack of scientific background or having some unique point of view. He well represents the average human being on this planet that just wants to do better. The global perspective of the film was also great because it offered many different views on how climate change is impacting the globe. The film made clear that the dangers of climate change are already affecting people’s ways of life around the globe. This varies from the intense level of pollution in Beijing, entire cities and countries consumed by floods, destroyed rainforests and natural habitats, and dying coral reefs. I also respect that the film delves into both the political and natural aspects of the climate change issue. 
  <br><br>

DiCaprio also talks important world figures, who are incredibly influential in the movement towards change. Though I also questioned DiCaprio as a U.N. Ambassador of Peace, I found it quite inspiring to see someone who was not a scientist or politician enacting change and representing the everyday person. His standing as a public figure in the climate crisis may help inspire people to become more involved in the process of both raising awareness and calling for greater sustainability. Despite his role as a messenger for the U.N., he recognizes that even the Paris Agreement may not be enough to enact change. Overall, I appreciated this film's insights and was inspired by DiCaprio's passion for environmentalism. I think it's incredible that someone who merely loves this planet and is attempting to learn more about the crisis is able to inspire an awareness of the severity of climate change and its effects on various parts of the globe, with the destruction of the planet's resources already affecting global populations.

The film Before the Flood is actually very fun and engaging to watch. Different than many documentaries I have seen, the film is structured around DiCaprio’s three-year journey of visiting places that experience climate change to a certain degree and talking to a range of people about what is happening and what their opinions are around the issue. Two of DiCaprio’s interviewees leave a deep impression on me. The first one was the native DiCaprio meets with on the Arctic ice. According to him, the ice, which used to be solid and dark blue, is now like ice cream. This is the first time I hear people associate real ice with ice cream, but such a description is incredibly vivid, since we all know that ice cream is soft and can melt quickly. The other interviewee that I remember very well is the man who emphasizes how much damage is done by beef production. I am shocked by the fact that even shifting our diet from beef to chicken would be extremely helpful for our environment. Maybe it would be hard to switch to not eating meat at all, but only switching from beef to chicken should be feasible and should be something that we all consider doing. 

  <br><br>

It is also interesting to see how some Chinese people act to address companies that do not meet the pollution standard and how Chinese media talks about climate change on a constant basis. This reminds me of an article I read on the Economist last year, titled “As China gets tough on pollution, will its economy suffer?” The article addresses two common concerns for stricter environmental policy--growth and inflation. Unexpectedly, China may be able to “raise its environmental standards without paying a high price.” It has forced tens of thousands of companies to close down, but its growth has been solid and inflation subdued. One possible explanation is that manufacturing industries such as steel or coal only account for about 7% of total national investment. Another possible explanation would be that green restrictions can themselves generate growth and jobs (for example, the market of electric cars has been expanding). As a developing country, China is willing to make a certain amount of “sacrifice” on development for a better environment in the long term. Maybe some other countries, especially the developed ones, should also try their best to take action (meaning, have stricter policies) as well. And we all should do something as individuals, like avoiding the consumption of beef. As it is said near the end of the film, there is a possibility for us to repair the poor trajectory we are having right now, but the question is, can we change our course in time?

An Inconvenient Sequel was another good documentary, emphasising the fact that the climate crisis is the truth we must seek and overcome. It is very effective in presenting Al Gore as someone we should believe in, and I believe he is doing a lot to help our climate crisis. As someone who has watched both Before the Flood and An Inconvenient Sequel, the way the protagonists are portrayed are very starkly different. Al Gore is presented as an experienced person when it comes to the climate crisis who knows a lot and has done a lot for the cause. Meanwhile, Leonardo DeCaprio is presented as someone more similar to the common person, who is still learning a lot in the process of the film about the climate crisis. While I really enjoyed An Inconvenient Sequel, I believe Leonardo DeCarpio’s role in Before the Flood was more relatable to the audience. Throughout the film, DeCaprio goes through an array of emotions including a feeling of despair, wondering if it was too late to make a change. That makes him more relatable as a protagonist, as the people watching are probably feeling similar emotions as they learn more and more about the severity of the climate crisis through the film. 
   <br><br>
However, An Inconvenient Sequel was still an amazing film dedicated to exposing the truth behind the climate crisis. I felt really inspired watching the film to know that there were politicians like Al Gore advocating for a change to help our world. After watching countless films where many people of power were trying to bury the truth of climate change, it was nice to see that there were also people of power who were dedicated to revealing the truth. We need people like Al Gore who are willing to take the initiative to make a change in this world. Even throughout his film, I could not believe the amount of people who wanted to bury the truth for the sake of their own wellbeing. So much is being sacrificed because of the power and influence of the fossil fuel industry, and I find that cruel and unjust. It gives me hope that there are people that are doing their best to make a change.

Having never heard or watched the film “Before the Flood” I was unaware of what was to come. I mean, I had some idea considering that the topic of the film had to do with our climate crisis but to what extent am I aware of the damage that is actually occuring to our earth? Clearly after watching the film I was educated with so much more information on our climate crisis than before watching the film. To start off, as embarrassing as this might seem, I had no idea that Leonardo DiCaprio has been an environmental activist for many years. I find it amazing that there are celebrities out there who actually care about our planet. Well of course there are public figures who care, right? But how many of them are actually taking time out of their day to research this critical issue and attempting to make a change? DiCaprio and the thousands of others who are involved give me hope for our future earth. There is a quote from the film that stated “this planet is a small boat and if it is sinking, we are all sinking together.” We must not only count on these environmental activist, scientist, higher figures, etc… to make a change. We all have to come together and change our lifestyles for the better of our planet; whether we want to hear it or not, we are all going to suffer from the consequences, so we might as well all take action.
    <br><br>
This film gave me so many different emotions such as frustration, anger, but most importantly hope. I was very frustrated to see that we are the ones who are destroying our planet. Of course I was aware of this before watching the film but when there are documentaries out there bringing awareness, showing clips of our earth burning, flooding, being completed destroyed, it makes one realize that this is serious. You can live on one side of the earth where no visible catastrophic changes have occured but there are millions of people who have experienced first hand suffering on the other side. Peoples homes are being destroyed, animals are dying, people are dying, all because of us. We are destroying millions of years of evolution. I am also very angry at these big corporations who have demolished our forests to create oil, leading to more fossil fuels being burned up. This just goes to show that these corporations don't care about anything but money, they don't believe in our climate crisis and they dont want too because they are money hungry and it's sickening to see but I believe everyone should know about this. I most definitely recommend this film to literally anybody and everybody. It has definitely taught me so much and pressured me to change my ways of living and I believe it most definitely will do the same to those who care.

I also didn’t know that Leonardo DiCaprio was involved in environmental activism. To know that there are famous figures educating themselves and attempting to educate the world about these topics also gave me hope. Actors like DiCaprio not only have a lot of money to be able to help in doing this, but they have large followings which make them ideal for gaining large audiences for these films. Because of these attributes, however, I don’t know that having DiCaprio “mirror” the audience in his quest for knowledge on the subject matter is particularly effective in what it tries to do. Because DiCaprio lives a very different life than the viewers, it can make it hard for them to see themselves in his position and he becomes more like a narrator than a role that each viewer can assume. 
  <br><br>


I agree with your view on the quote “this planet is a small boat and if it is sinking, we are all sinking together.” This gave me hope as well because, like you said, we all have to come together to make the change, and if we can eventually get to that point of agreement then we definitely can make those changes. It does make me worrisome though knowing that we have tried to do this already with the Paris agreement and the US, a leading nation, has backed out. It makes me, like you, angry at the oil companies because not only are they some of the primary polluters, but they are also the ones paying the politicians to keep denying and neglecting these issues. They are the ones sinking our small boat just in name of getting more money.

  <br><br>

I am glad that you will recommend this film to others and that you think it will pressure them into changing. I agree with you that it will pressure people who care into changing. However, those are the people that I don’t worry about. I am most concerned about the people who don’t care, like the large oil companies, and I am worried about how we can get them to change with us.

Before watching Before the Flood, I had no idea about the immense scale of humanity’s involvement in global warming.  I only knew about global warming on a surface level.  Before the Flood is effective in showing the effects of global warming by showing different examples of it.  Having a visual representation helps people get a sense of how we are affecting the world.  For example, I was shocked when they held the 30 foot hose that used to be under the ice.  Seeing the oil sands made me think about the forest and wildlife that was destroyed for it.  Also, having Dicaprio as a main role helps this film reach a wider audience, thus communicating the impact of global warming to more people.  It’s unbelievable how many politicians are so easily bought out by big fossil fuel companies, which in turn leads to more global warming deniers.  I don’t understand how they can deny that it exists when there is so much evidence of its impact.  Even though America is a first world country, it is still lagging behind less wealthy countries like China and India in terms of developing renewable energy.  At the end, the film lists different ways in which each of us can help support the prevention of global warming.  I’m sure that the film has inspired many to learn more about this problem .

I agree with what you said about global warming deniers. Politicians are supposed to speak out for their people and the fact that they place their own benefits over us and subsequent generations, even though there is so many clear evidence of effects of climate change, definitely makes me feel furious. In addition, I believe that rich countries should set an example to relatively poor countries in terms of developing renewable energies. Therefore, I’m really proud of countries like China, which has devoted itself in developing renewable energies even though the country itself is still developing. In general, the film definitely helped raise my awareness of saving the planet from carbon dioxide and I’m sure more people are motivated by the film to protect the earth.

Film: Before the Flood:
  <br><br>
Before the Flood, a film directed by Fisher Stevens, is narrated by well known celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio acknowledges his lack of scientific knowledge on the subject of climate change but proves his willingness to learn as he travels the world talking to various scientists and people with Interesting perspectives to get to the bottom of the causes and cures to climate change. Climate change is widely disputed in todays media, to the point where those who believe it to be true suffer extreme backlash. DiCaprio was named the messenger of peace on climate change for the UN in 2014 and as soon as the news got out major media networks such as FOX News began to ridicule him for not having a background in science. This is reasonable but what is the media's reasoning behind harassing a man who published a graph illustrating the "Proxy Reconstructions of Past Climate," calling him a con artist and completely slandering his name. Corruption in the government, media, and big business is effectively skewing the public's opinion on climate change. This wheel of corruption starts with major oil companies and others who benefit from the public not believing in climate change buying the words of others. James Inhofe is a senator of the united states who denies climate change and also happens to receive $1,837,427 from major fossil fuel companies. What a coincidence. Certain media outlets project these opinions and create credibility by broadcasting individuals with scientific credentials to reveal biased data to the uneducated public. This film was full of shock value. Most of these issues I was completely unaware of. Cars and cable are basics of life in America and most developed nations across the world. It is so easy to sit in your air conditioned dorm room and forget about the smoldering heat and disarrayed weather patterns in the outside world. Economy is centered on fossil fuels; coal, oil, and natural gasses. These sources are used to power the transportation sector, electricity, manufacturing, and countless other processes that are necessities in today's world. Burning of fossil fuels releases harmful greenhouse gasses into the earth's atmosphere causing earth's weather conditions to change dramatically. But it is the things that no one talks about that are destroying the world. The food industry is another major player releasing fossil fuels into the environment. Forests in the amazon are being burned down to raise cattle and forests in Indonesia are being burned down to grow palm oil plantations. Not only does the burning of trees stop them from absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen but the combustion reaction of burning wood releases even more carbon into the atmosphere. This is channeling a massive positive loop reaction of carbon emission. The film ends with a somewhat hopeful outlook, looking into renewable energy sources and the steps other nations have taken to prevent further destruction of the planet. This documentary left me shaking in anger and anticipation for the future, I want to make an impact but the government keeps shutting down efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. The world is protesting, begging our leaders to notice. Many countries are actively making an effort to lower their greenhouse gas emissions but if America doesn't strive to do better the entire world will face the harsh consequences.

The film Before the Flood is really a fantastic film on the topic of environment protection, especially about the protection release of greenhouse gases and burning of fossil fuel. For me, this film really teaches me a lot that it gives me a whole brand-new view on the problem regarding climate crisis. 
  <br><br>
Before watching the film, things like climate crisis and environmental protections were just big topics that seems really faraway from me, from our normal day life. I never imagine that the situation is that serious. However, after watching the film, I realize the emergency of taking action immediately to change the situation. Just as what those experts said it is not too late to take actions now to revert the situation and save our future. In my mind, one of the most important things to do now is to inform more and more people about the truth of the situation of climate crisis. Many of the population still did not know the reality nowadays, because of the sayings of those companies which depends on fossil fuels. The power of the population can be strong to influence everything including policy and economy. Therefore, letting more and more people learn something about the truth and watch these films can be important. Nowadays, many people, companies, and countries has already started to do something to help change the situation, such as searching for new renewable energies. I think these are definitely good for the climate and environment but still not enough. These are only a tiny proportion of the whole population of the world taking action to protect the environment. More people is needed to realize the situation and try to reduce the release of those greenhouse gases to make a significant change.

Film: An Inconvenient Sequel
  <br><br>


Going into this movie, I had known that Climate Change was severely impacting our environment, but I had not quite realized the extent. When Gore mentioned that 14 of the 15 recent years were the hottest years ever, I was surprised. I didn’t realize that we were currently experiencing the effects of Climate Change and Global warming to that extent. I had envisioned it as a problem I/we would have to deal with 20-30 years down the line, not day to day. Looking back at my own experiences, I can anecdotally say that the local weather in my hometown has been unusual. In my hometown in the Bay Area, it snowed last winter (2019) while I was away for college. Snow is so incredibly uncommon in that area, that it hasn’t been seen for well over 50 years. Additionally, last two years ago we had a summer with 114 Fahrenheit temperature. Climate change has an overwhelming amount of scientific backing, and the majority of well educated individuals understand that it is concerning:however there are skeptics. I feel that Gore alienates the skeptics with certain alarmist footage, such as the video of the glaciers exploding. I wonder if it is more effective to call believers to action, or if it is more effective to attempt to convince deniers? This film does a good job of convincing believers that action must be taken, but alienates deniers. 
  <br><br>

One thing I did not expect coming into this video was a focus on democracy. I think that this part of the movie is critical in order to enact change. Younger individuals have a poor voting turnout, and poor political efficacy, I think that a call to action to take action within our democracy was effective. 
  <br><br>

Something I was surprised about Gore’s belief in Solar as the best outlet for renewable energy. I had long thought that Wind was better than PV cells. Also surprised that the life expectancy in China is decreasing due to air pollution. I found the Indian agreement subplot to be a bit longer than necessary. I didn’t find it too useful in giving hope, which is what I presume the point was, however I did learn new information in that section. I find it sad in some ways that developing countries like India will admirably forego fossil fuels for renewable energy, when we cannot achieve that at home. Overall I’d rate the film 6.5/10. It is entertaining and informative in places, but it was neither enlightening nor rather entertaining.

Hi! I really like how you draw connections between the movie and the unusual weather back in your hometown. Sometimes I hear that people who encounter unusual snow use it as evidence against global warming, so I did some research on global warming and unusual snowfall. It turns out that warming leads to more evaporation from the ocean, which leads to more moisture in the air, which leads to more extreme precipitation events.

In the 8 chapters of the uninhabitable earth, David mentioned the concept which is mentioned in Before The Flood, the city on the coast will be destroyed in recent years. In Before The Flood, this concept is talked more detailly. The mayor of Miami said "The ocean is not Republican and it's not Democrat. All it knows how to do, is rise". The major also displays the cost of climate change, the 400 million dollar project which only can be used for 40 to 50 years. This project can benefit citizens nothing but avoid the rising of the ocean.

smartly uses celebrity charm. Leonardo is a worldwide known actor. Through the documentary, I can find that he tries to achieve something beyond the fame, money, and power. He wants to really help the human through his way. For him, this is more than a show. However, he can not do anything more than spread the opinions of environmental scientists. He still spend most of time on his business. This documentary will be a good introductory resource for potential audiences. However, the documentary is hard to have more influence. 

  <br><br>


The global warming becomes a tool for politicians to get votes. This does not mean the politicians do not care about environmental issues, but in the short term, the touchable benefit forces politicians to stand on another perspective. In the same situation for the citizens, they do care about environmental issues, but comparing with the job and money, the environment is not important anymore. The propaganda of Leonardo only can affect a really small portion of his audience who has time and money and no more other desire.

Before the Flood was one of the more well done documentaries in regard to climate change that I have seen. Leonardo Dicaprio properly gained the audience's trust by noting in the beginning that he did not know enough about the subject and wished to gain more knowledge. With going all around the world and explaining the different aspects of climate change through scientists and specialists, he showed the public the reality we are facing today. Through visible proof that this is a real danger to society, he gave his viewers the proper background needed for them to instigate a change, whether its in their community or on a larger level, like Greta Thunberg. This documentary must be viewed by climate change doubters and non-believers, because it gives excessive evidence to its existence. Logically, there is no reason for international leaders to lie to the public, make this a pressing issue, or implement international agreements if climate change did not exist. It was interesting to see the different political leaders around the world being so grappled by the subject, as opposed to the US congressmen and political leaders who are so divided on it. It is in America where we should be taking the most action, due to our ginormous carbon footprint. Throughout the past couple of decades, giant food corporations have made our society rely on their products. With the increased demand, they have expanded astronomically, and are about to dictate political leaders' decisions in regard to keeping each other in power. These corporations pour money into certain political leaders' campaigns, and as a trade, the leader votes against anything that could negatively affect the given corporation. It is a vicious cycle that is pervasive among the Senate and House of Representatives. Something like the detrimental effects of climate change could hurt these big corporations, hence why so many lawmakers believe climate change is a hoax. Dicaprio allowed me to see this correlation much more clearly when viewing the decisions of many republican lawmakers, as well as our own president, throughout the past couple years. Personally, I believe that climate change is the biggest problem the world must focus on currently. In order to do this, we must vote for leaders who will vote for the battle against climate change. If we don't, the Earth will continue to warm, and destruction will ensue. Leonardo shows that how in a sense, the Earth is negatively reacting to all of the pollution humans are putting into the atmosphere by creating tornados, floods, more frequent and aggressive hurricanes, the poisoning of our oceans, and so on. Overall, the film was enlightening yet chilling in the fact that we are late to making active change. It is inspiring to see a celebrity as acclaimed as Leonardo Dicaprio invest over two years in the subject in order to educate the public. In the American world we live in today, a celebrity like him will make the culture-obsessed population actually listen to the problems we must act upon fast.

I watched, “Before the flood” and I am surprised this hasn’t come across my life before. I feel that if more people knew about this film and what it entailed people would be more willing to talk about climate change and act on it. Something brought upon my attention that I did not know what that companies that produce the most fossil fuels have pretty much bought out congress meaning congress is making money from these companies, which is why it is so hard to get a climate change bill passed. Congress is aware of what’s going on. It is frustrating that America is knowingly doing this to the planet. While other countries like India have over 700 million households using biomass to cook. And this isn’t because they cannot afford coal, coal is very cheap, they do it for the planet. This video really puts in perspective how selfish America is and that people need to do something about it, even a small diet change could help make the difference. America is not the only one, but the biggest one.

I agree that the fact that climate change is still being debated and argued is aggravating and frustrating for a lot of people because the facts and science is clear and obvious, but it is the money and greed that creates ignorance and denial in some people. Politicians are willing to ignore the biggest crisis our world currently faces for their own personal gain of money and power. It was eye opening to learn that 300 million people in India don’t have access to electricity and are forced to cook with biomass. While millions and millions of people are struggling to live in harmful and dangerous conditions, politicians are still choosing to ignore what is going on in order to make more money and please their supporters, most of which are part of the fossil fuel industry. 
  <br><br>
Once we get past this standstill within our government and get people elected who realize the danger that is coming in our near future on this planet, I believe that things will start looking better for us. But, if we keep doing what we are doing, and elect the wrong people to run our country, things will get inevitably worse. 
  <br><br>
I personally was very inspired and motivated by what Dr. Piers Sellers mentioned. His life was coming to an end and he wanted to do what he could in the short amount of time that he had. I feel like all of us should act in this way. We all have a pretty short time on this planet, so we should choose to make it useful and try to improve what the planet will be like for future generations. An interesting idea that was brought up at the end of “Before the Flood” was that we need to imagine what our children and grandchildren will think when they learn that we had the means and ability to stop this catastrophe, but the political and economic barriers kept us from doing so. We are at a point where we need to ignore individual needs and wishes and start thinking about how we can help our planet as a whole.

Before the Flood: Wow. This film absolutely stunned me. First off, Leonardo DiCaprio really did a pleasing job of revealing and unearthing realities that we as regular people are not aware of. The film as a whole captured exactly what climate change is and what the implications of our actions are, all while it was very admitting that even DiCaprio was learning with us along the way. I believe this was extremely important because it made the entire message more real and relatable. It is difficult to watch and listen to many of the facts and theories that are presented, but this is reality and this is happening all while we speak. I can see how many people would become uncomfortable while viewing it and want to stop watching, but shouldn't that send the message that this reality needs to be more known to the public? The documentary takes us on a trip around the world which further propels the argument that this really is a global fight, not just a fight for those countries that it seems to be affecting more. What I thought was the most interesting is that although India and China are part of the world's biggest polluters is that they spend the most on investing in solar energy alternatives or other things to improve the lives of their people. So while we may think that these countries are absolutely horrible for producing so much waste, they still are doing more for the climate crisis than we are. I appreciated that the film touched on the meat industry and that DiCaprio as a vegan himself was able to project the message of not completely cutting out meat, but the impact that eating less meat can have on our planet. It absolutely maddens me that there are politicians and people who genuinely believe that climate change can be reversed very easily or that it is not real at all and that the reason it is happening is because of something we cannot control. There are dozens of scientists and actual facts that clearly lay out the implications of climate change and how real it is. The comments that reporters make about climate change and those who support it becomes much too personal to even be an ethical battle, and becomes more about political lines rather than our home as a whole. This film was a wake up call for me and many other people who decide that they want to view it. 
  <br><br>


During lecture when Ken explained that many people do not want to be aware of the problem because it makes it easier to deal with, really resonated with me. I believe that his statement about how people are not aware of the real implications of climate change contributes to the notion that America is not a problem. We are a problem and probably one of the biggest ones! It goes to show how bad the situation really is if this many people choose not to learn about the harsh reality that will be our home if we do not change. By taking a class like this and spreading the knowledge about the climate, we are able to create more change and make a bigger difference when it comes to global climate change.

The film “Before the Flood” allowed me to understand the dangers that are occurring on Earth due to climate change. One thing that shocks me is how many people still believe that climate change is a hoax and is a lie to the public, especially, people who have the power to influence other citizens that do not understand what climate change is exactly. People with fame have the ability to affect many’s knowledge of helping the Earth but instead of believing that climate change is occurring, they simply brush it off and saying that the scientists and individuals who do believe are happening are “dumb”. Hearing public figures say that anger me because people with little knowledge of what is going on will believe them because they are famous and must be saying the correct fact, which is not true. I hope there will be more public figures that believe climate change is real and will educate others without having to be paid or done for something in return. They should do it based on their own will to save the Earth so that the next generation could potentially still live here. 
  <br><br>
Knowing the threats of climate change allows me to learn what I need to do as an individual in order to slow down climate change enough so Earth can become itself again. Though knowing the threats of climate change is scary, I feel that seeing what is happening in certain countries due to climate change appeals to people’s emotion which is a good thing because it’ll lead them to do the right thing, such as knowing what to buy, how to reduce waste, and what to eat.
  <br><br>
I think having Leonardo DiCaprio as the climate ambassador is not a bad choice. His fame definitely helps with publicity because he is so famous. Everyone knows him for being in The Titanic and if climate change is also attached to his name, it would give climate change more exposure to the public. Even though there are perks to having him as the ambassador, I feel like people will also not take him seriously because he doesn’t really know much about climate change. If it was someone who studied years of climate change, it would increase his credibility but for DiCaprio, it feels like he doesn’t know enough to be lecturing people on climate change. I still think DiCaprio as an ambassador is a good choice.

The sheer amount of people who dismiss climate change as a hoax is also alarming and shocking to me. It’s so frustrating that evidence could be presented in various ways to the public, including insightful documentaries like Before the Flood and An Inconvenient Truth, and yet there will still be people who will turn up their noses at the mention of climate change. 
<br><br>
I also agree that Leonardo DiCaprio is a good choice for both the “face” of Before the Flood and the climate ambassador. Though he does not have extensive knowledge on the ins and outs of the climate crisis, he seems very eager to learn in order to use his platform as a celebrity to educate others and convince them to listen.

I thought the film “Before the Flood” was an excellent way to introduce people to the subject of climate change. It definitely kept me engaged throughout the whole hour and a half as it should with anyone who watches it. I think the succinctness of the film was very effective since as the film mentions, once people bring up climate change, others tend to zone out. DiCaprio engages the viewers by taking us on his beautiful journey around the world to see the devastating effects that anthropogenic climate change has had on the most beautiful landscapes and ecosystems on the planet. He is also very insightful as he demonstrates what kind of person he his in terms of his stance on this issue and the steps he is taking to seek answers. 
  <br><br>

The three things that surprised me the most about the film was that by 2040 we will be able to sail across the North Pole because there will be no arctic sea ice, palm oil is used in basically everything consumers buy in everyday markets, and producing half of a hamburger produces the same amount of energy needed to power a light bulb for 200 hours. This made me want to change my lifestyle in two seconds. Our lifestyle is the problem. We need to be able to adjust to these solutions as a society because our lives will literally depend on it. Along with our contributions, we also need political change from the people who have the power to change the laws. The films political aspect was my favorite part of the film because it ties it all together. The Pope is right, the Paris Agreement was a huge step in the right direction but it is simply not enough. We need enforcements on the regulations outlined in the agreement and a carbon tax will be very beneficial in the end. All in all, the film is an accurate way to learn about our climate crisis and nudges people in the right direction in potentially changing their lifestyles or even just educating them on the subject that people think is too difficult to understand.

 I completely agree with what you had to say about the film “Before the Flood.” I think DiCaprio was an excellent choice to be the protagonist because he is a fan favorite between many generations, plus his eagerness to learn and the way he relayed the information throughout the movie was very interesting.  
 <br><br>

I was also surprised to hear about those things, but what makes it worse for me is the fact that this film was made in 2016, four years ago we had an A-lister actor in a film telling the public we need to make a change and we need to make it now. Four years later and we are still making the same mistakes, we are still being selfish, and we are continuing to release more and more CO2 every day. I also agree with the pope, the Paris Agreement would have had an amazing impact in terms of slowing down climate change. Unfortunately, the Paris Agreement is the equivalent of a toddler promising their parents that they won’t throw a fit in the toy store. If the toddler keeps the promise than cool, but the odds are the kid will want something and throw a fit about it, he/she won’t get any real punishment, maybe just a slap on the wrist and being told don’t do that again for it. This is essentially what the Paris Agreement does, all the countries who signed stated that they will try to stay within their given limits, but there are no real repercussions for not doing so. Those who do not stay within their agreed limits the people will just be disappointed with them. Overall I thought the film was very educational and thought-provoking.

Before the Flood: Initially I had the same thought as many of the media clips shown: What does Leonardo DiCaprio have to do with the environment. His dedication to educating himself on the issues we face is respectable. Being a well known actor, he possesses a certain credibility with a large group of people. This recognition likely played a major part in his selection though, because while DiCaprio has no experience with the environment, information presented by him is likely to be heard by many more people than would listen to the same words coming from an unknown scientist. The image of the hose from the climate station being stretched out to show the length of the hose that had previously been submerged in ice was particularly startling. The idea that such a significant amount of ice had melted in a relatively short period of time. Seeing the flooded fields in India was a good way to exemplify how poorer people must face the consequences of climate change to a greater degree than those with the wealth to protect themselves. An entire harvest completely destroyed by a half of a typical year of rain, dumped within 5 hours. The inefficiency of beef production is ridiculous, but with it being so common in our society, converting typical diets to consume less red meat is going to be more of a struggle than we realize. People tend to be unwelcoming to change, particularly is it is perceived as forced on them.
 <br><br>


The idea that many people do not want to face the truth about climate change is true. Whether that be because they have not felt the effects of climate change (or at least realized it) or because ignorance is bliss. Many people simply aren't willing to go out of their way to educate themselves.

First of all, Ivery much agree with your assertion that the information being presented in “Before the Flood” is sure to be seen as much more credible due to it being presented by Leonardo Dicaprio. Statements made in the film certainly have a particular ethos due to his widespread success and popularity, and I think that it can go a long way in convincing viewers of the film’s points. I do disagree however with your statement that Dicaprio has “no experience with the environment,” considering that early in the film he is shown being announced as the UN Messenger of Peace for Climate Change, and also later he talks about his early fascination with the wiping out of species by early settlers and explorers. While not formal scientific experiences that one may have at a university, it is clear that these were experiences learning about the environment, and the effects from these experiences caused Dicaprio to take an interest in trying help stop climate change later in his life.
<br><Br>

Secondly, I was also astonished at the inefficiencies of beef production that were highlighted in the film. The fact that 70% of the U.S. land used for food production is dedicated just to grow feed for cattle is almost hard to comprehend, especially when you consider that these animals give off methane, a very strong greenhouse gas where each molecule in the atmosphere is equivalent to 23 molecules of CO2. While I agree that it may be difficult to convince people to consume less red meat, I believe that the trick to helping them make the change is actually not to force it on them but rather to lead by example and show them that delicious and healthy meals can be made without the beef that they are used to eating. I believe it is also important to inform people that they can begin the transition by cutting down on their consumption first, so that they do not think they must cut out all beef at once.

Before the Flood: While watching this film I was at first very confused about the choice of Leonardo DiCaprio as the ambassador for this issue. Many people have expressed opinions about celebrities tackling the issue of climate change due to their carbon footprint being substantially higher than the average person, however, DiCaprio makes a point to put himself in the shoes of the average American, and even points out that he also takes part in the issue. He does "play dumb" a little bit throughout the film, asking exactly the right questions to prompt the answer that he wants to hear to fit the agenda that the film wants to pursue. Nonetheless, the film approaches climate change with experts that are pushing alarmist tactics and alerting the audience to the dangers of rising ocean levels, rising temperatures, and the dangers of the air quality we would ultimately be produced everywhere, not just China. The film features Barack Obama and he addresses the issue in a sentimental way, distraught over the fact that his grandchildren may not get the chance to experience what he did as a child, for example, snow. Snow will become increasingly scarce in the coming years and to have a chance to see it will be rare. In addition to the terrifying reality of the Earth becoming uninhabitable, the issue of not being able to feed people once the record droughts begin and the fact that cities need to be renovated due to rising ocean levels, even when renovations may only last 40 years, there's also the issue of people just simply not believing in climate change. I think that this is due to the fact that people don't want to give up the lifestyle that they have been accustomed to, especially in the United States. As the team traveled to India in the film, they were told that Americans should set an example for the rest of the world to follow, but unfortunately, American's are wrapped up in the lifestyle and the diet that they have always known and most people aren't willing to listen to the changes that we could be making. The film definitely hit all the bases for the issue of climate change covering diet and ice melting to temperature increases and changes in the weather pattern. 
 <br><br>
Despite the best efforts from everyone who believes that this is a pressing issue, everyone needs to play a part, and unfortunately, not everyone will. The only way to ensure that a change happens is to vote and to pass laws regarding the issue and to do the small part that one is able to. The big industries, such as the fossil fuel industry need to be stopped and alternatives need to be put in place to ensure the future of the planet.

When I was watching the documentary “Before the Flood,” I was shocked to see how climate change has affected different parts of the world. In the Arctic Circle, it is hard to believe that the huge amount of blue solid ice has melted in just 10 years! This documentary has widened my horizon. It has not just displayed a fact to those who do not believe in global warming; it has also allowed us to reflect on ourselves on how should we continue to eliminate methane and carbon dioxide. To add on, the documentary has included news clips of multiple scientists and politicians. It allows viewers to listen to the opinion of the other side. At first, I do not understand why there are people who deny the occurrence of climate change. Every day, when we surf online, we can observe there are news and scientific reports on frequent drought, flood, sea-level rise, and wildfire. After I watched this documentary, it makes me realized that it’s not that people do not believe; it’s that they are scared to believe or are paid to not believe. Fossil fuels have given us convenience and a better living standard; it has also generated wealth for many enterprises. As a result, people are reluctant to face the crisis of climate change. Seeing this, we should start from ourselves to encourage others to join the process of slowing down global warming.

I completely agree with you! When I was watching the film it was particularly interesting to see leaders from many different countries and see how they are being proactive in the fight against climate change. One interaction, in particular, was when Leonardo was discussing the status of India's energy usage with Sunita Narain. In his conversation with her, it was apparent how much India will suffer in this climate crisis and how much the U.S contributes to these climate issues without doing anything about the repercussions. It's so important that this film focuses on so many different countries and all the different ways that the climate is changing, from fires to melting ice caps. For a viewer, especially an American who is stuck in the middle of the political debate of whether or not the climate is actually changing. This documentary allows the audience to see that there are other scientific perspectives on the issue other than just that of the U.S. government I highly recommend to anyone who has not to see this documentary to see it, so you can really visually see the change that our earth is undergoing and how it is possible for us to make a change for our environment. 

<br><br>
Also, I think it was interesting to see Leonardo being the narrator for this documentary instead of a scientist because he is being educated through this process just like the rest of us. Even though he receives a lot of flack for using his actor status to create this documentary, I think it was the right platform to get people to pay attention.
<Br><hr>
First I would like to say almost everything that you said in your comment is what I took from the film. “Before the Flood,” was nearly a preview of what was stated in Wells article, “The Uninhabitable Earth.” Exactly as what happened to you, this film also has widened my horizon about the harsh realities of climate change. The film really made me begin to think of my own carbon footprint and how I can clean up the things I do in my everyday life. I appreciated how political figures and climate scientists were incorporated into the film because as you said it allows us to see this issue from every perspective. In my own opinion I believe this is the best way to go about it because not only will it help people to convert from their original beliefs, but also make their new beliefs stronger as they are tested. It was saddening to see how what the United States has been doing as of recent have strongly affected other countries that are not able to properly protect themselves. One part of the film that stood out to me was when Leonardo visited India and how passionate Sunita Narain was about her country being badly affected by the climate crisis. She put it into perspective of how much damage the United States, but also pointed out that nothing will change unless the United States changes. I completely agree with your statements regarding how much fossil fuels has provided for us and that is why this debate is even a thing because it is hard to give up convenience and wealth for many. Although it is hard, it is something that must be done in order to save our planet. If we want to change the world, we must start with ourselves.
<Br><hr>
 I agree with you very much. This is my second time watching the film "Before the Flood". It’s one of my favorite movies from English 22. I had the same reaction with you when I first movie. I thought humans just can’t influence the environment significantly. Until I watched this movie, I realized one day we will become the biggest culprit of destroying the Earth. Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor and also a great environmentalist. He provides lots of evidence that prove the problem of climate change really exists. Such as the area of ice melting for five years in Greenland, the sea level rise in Florida and the more frequently nature extreme disaster on Earth. I admire his journey and career life. Although he is just an actor, I think what he had done more than normal people like us. Climate change is a very slow temperature rising process. Everyone knows about climate change and there are always some people refuse to accept the truth. And I can tell you why there are people who deny the occurrence of climate change. Because our economy is basically built on fossil fuel, fossil fuel interests will sponsor climate change denial’s websites, news media, and organizations in order to earn more money and get more benefits. We can’t do anything to change this situation. But we can change ourselves. As you said, we should start from ourselves to encourage others to join the process of slowing down global warming. Great review!
<Br><hr>
I totally agree with what you said. When I finished the film, I felt different about climate change. It gives me more information about the crisis. And also I was shocked too to see how climate change has affected different parts of world. Be honestly, I can not imagine climate change would have such more influence on the earth. Whatever, it was good to watch the film.
<Br><hr>
Yes, I agree with you in all the points you have said, it is shocking to see how climate change has started to affect other parts of the world. It was my first time watching “Before the Flood”, and to be completely honest I did not know what to expect, maybe something general about climate change. When I saw Leonardo DiCaprio as the main character of the documentary, I was a bit uneasy, but as the movie progressed, I realized that he has been an activist for years and genuinely cares about the environment. Greenhouse gases play a major role in climate change and the United States is one of the biggest contributors. Methane is far worse than CO2, and because of the food culture the United States we are emitting a large amount into the atmosphere because of cattle. I find it very selfish of us, just because we want to eat beef climate change is affecting other parts of the world. Simply by changing from beef to chicken the amount of methane released would be significantly lowered.
<Br><hr>
I am, along with everyone who commented in this post, in the same boat as you after watching the documentary "Before the Flood". By the same "boat" I mean literally, I imagined humanity in a boat cruising through the melted glacier lakes of our Planet, looking for a new home similar to the situation of Polar Bears, if we do not take action as soon as possible. The film did not simply widened my horizon, but has also gave me itch that we got to do something. We can't simply just preach about climate change but we got some immediate actions to back it up just like the Pope said in the film. 

<br><Br>
Additionally, I will have to also agree with you regarding our leaders and how they are heavily reliant on economic profits. According to Gregory Mankiw, He believes that the public could definitely shift leaders view by practicing what they care about. I felt really disappointed and I found an irony within humanity that we seem to be blind on the real issue here, which is climate change, thus correlates to our existence and how long we could survive as humans. Our political leaders is run by the coined term of fossil capitalism by Wells' article, "The Uninhabitable Earth", I have discovered the same outcome that you have discovered, which is there more profit in not believing about Climate Change, rather than fix it. For these reasons, although it may seem difficult for us to unite or at least influence our political leaders, I, You, and Everyone around us could definitely make our impact in saving our Planet.

<Br><hr>
I completely agree with the premises in your response.  By watching “Before the Flood” I became much more aware of the effect climate change has on different parts of the world.  I loved when you drew a distinction between not believing in climate change and the absolute terror believing in climate change provokes.  I think that in the United States, facing the reality of climate change means looking internally to the outrageous amount we each contribute to it.  It is so much easier to look the other way than face reality, especially when the reality is if we do not change the way we live the result will be the end of human life as we know it.
<br><Br>


My favorite part of the film was DiCaprio’s interview with Sunita Narain where they discuss India’s energy use.  I thought that this provided a window into the issue many developing countries are facing; without common access to basic necessities such as shelter and running water, it is impossible to tackle the issue of climate change head on, especially without the leadership of developed countries.  Her point stands on solid ground; if developed countries, such as the United States, do not reduce fossil fuel emissions yet preach about the importance of renewable resources, how are developing countries supposed to make that leap with no support?  This film makes clear the difficulties of solving the climate crisis but shows its possibility if developed nations pave the way.

<Br><hr>
I agree with you, before this film I was a bit suspicious if climate change could happen that fast! Seeing how much ice melted in just 10 years makes me think about how much ice will melt in 50 years with the global temperature continuously rising! With Leonardo being such an influential actor, I hope he can have as big of an influence on those who haven't yet started their journey on minimizing their carbon footprint. Touching on your comment about how fossil fuels have given us a better standard of living, it has also given many other countries better standards of living because it has created many jobs and wealth for countries that might not have as much without it, but, we all have to sacrifice something if we want to slow down climate change sadly. While I don't think that these large companies will just stop extracting fossil fuels, I do think that if everyone cut down on their usage, we wouldn't be supporting their business and maybe they will be forced to shut down or minimize their businesses.

Film(Before the Flood) - There is one frame impress me a lot that when they are in the pole, the ice is baby blue and much thinner than I presume. For people living within cities, climate change may not be so obvious. However, throughout this movie, climate crisis really happens everywhere. People destroy natural environment for economy. I just hope more people will become to aware what are the right things to do regarding environment.

An Inconvenient Sequel -- It is a shame that the governor of Florida could be so negligent in acknowledging the threat of climate change has on Florida, and especially Miami. The interesting point that Gore made that our Democracy has been hacked, since politicians have sold themselves to capitalism and big corporations that they, in fact, do not represent the people living in the territories they represent, but these big businesses that contribute to climate change. Seeing how fossil fuel industries have lobbed Florida legislature to ban the use of solar panels unless it is purchased from these same fossil fuel companies is frustrating. 
  <br><Br>
 The representative from India did make some points in his claim that while many nations are supportive of the U.S., the U.S. does not seem to reciprocate this energy back and does not seem to be as supportive in the efforts to combat climate change. He is right that the U.S. does, in fact, create impediments to the goal of ending climate change.
  <br><Br>
It was astonishing to see how difficult it was to even walk in India, as the streets were literally melting. It shows that us living in the U.S. can be blind to believe in climate change because we have not seen as evident of consequences of climate change here in the U.S., but it is much more obvious and dangerous to poorer nations. As stated in the film, “The greatest effects of the climate crisis are experienced by the poorest. Every storm that takes place now is much different because it takes place in a warmer and wetter world. We can see how drastic the consequences are in examples such as in the Philippines and even in New York.
<br><Br>
    The film also showed some glimpse of hope by showing that some places can and have try to effectively combat the climate crisis by converting to renewable energy. It is nice to see that there are a couple cities in the U.S. that are 100% renewable energy and that there are many on the way. But is also disappointing that some of these cities are motivated to convert to renewable energy because they see the economic interests of it, as seen in the city in Texas.

I feel like the film “Before the Flood” was very effective in translating the crisis we are in with the climate because it takes opinions from various different perspectives that will evidently reach a larger audience. There is a republican economist, spiritual illusions, the opinions of varying countries, and much more that evidently provides a wide scale of perspectives on the climate change issue. I feel like this film did a great job alerting the public about the situation we are in while also providing solutions the viewer, as an individual, can do today. For myself, I felt highly motivated to stop my beef consumption and think about my actions and carbon footprint. 

  <br><Br>

I admire Leonardo Dicaprio using his fame and influence to actively voice his concerns about climate change and being someone who will fight for the cause no matter how terrifying and difficult. The most eye-opening scene for me was the nasa astronaut, Piers Sellers who was able to show climate changes effects on earth from the perspective of space. The broad perspective allows the viewer to see the grand impact it is having and how complicated the weather changes can be. In addition to his diagram, Seller’s optimistic message about his best wishes for the future of our climate despite his short time left on Earth was extremely heart-warming and impactful. He said “I believe in humans” and that stuck with me because I also believe humans will want what is best for our future. Once we get past the fear and cloud of confusion around climate change, humans will be the solution we need to be.

I definitely agree that the movie took a very effective approach to the topic of climate change. Instead of just speaking with American politicians or environmentalists, DiCaprio traveled all around the world to have conversations with different people from different countries, backgrounds, and political views. This definitely created a more lively and interesting documentary and led me to want to research some of the people interviewed in the movie. The scene with the NASA astronaut also stuck out to me and I cannot even imagine how astonishing it must be to actually look at our planet from outer space. I remember him mentioning how this made him appreciate the earth and its population more and cherish what nature has given us. Additionally, I was really impressed by the simulation showing how the earth will change in the next few decades and cannot imagine how anyone would still deny that climate change is happening after seeing that simulation. I was also very inspired by the NASA astronaut deciding to use his limited time on earth for raising awareness about the climate crisis and fight against it as best as he could. 
<br><br>

Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the only celebrities who continuously proves that he actually does care about the climate crisis. I totally agree with you that his decision to use his fame for good is admirable. I will never understand why there aren't more people in the public eye who are using their platform to raise awareness for important issues and take advantage of the resources they have as a celebrity. Of course us "normal people" should speak out about those topics as well, but it is no secret that celebrities would have far more impact and influence on a larger group of people than most of us ever will. This is also why I believe that using a famous person as the protagonist of a documentary is a very effective way of ensuring a broader audience. I really hope that this film will continue to educate people about the reality of our climate crisis because it definitely helped me understand the magnitude of the problem.
<br><hr>
I feel as though this comment encapsulates not only my thoughts on the film, but the point Professor Hiltner makes in his lecture video. DiCaprio is a surrogate to the viewer. He is providing us with the experiences we personally cannot immerse ourselves in. I believe that DiCaprio is aware off this, and utilizes a multitude of viewpoints, as you state; a republican economist, various country leaders, and many more---and in doing so reaches a larger audience. I believe that the reach of this film is what is so important. A larger audience leads to larger action; and we've learned that action is a very important aspect of preventing further Climate change. 
<br><br>

Another aspect of the film that I found particularly moving were the words of Sunita Narain. She challenged DiCaprio on India's role in climate change, and explain how the U.S. and other already developed countries need to be setting an example. We need to be the ones moving into the solar industry, cutting the amount of land used for beef farming, and so many more things. Her point is absolutely spot on. If other countries, who don't have many of the luxuries we have, view us not making any changes, they will conclude that changes don't need to be made. The U.S needs to take action, and quickly. 
<br><br>

Overall the film left me feeling a bit discouraged. I saw many aspects of human activity that I have never seen before. The devastations shown in this film; deforestation, oil rigs, and more, helped me see how major of a problem human activity is. Seeing these negative actions up close truly moved something within me.

<br><hr>

I also was enthused by one of the solutions set forth by the documentary as a response to climate change. Eating less beef may not seem like a big deal, but the fact is, if every person substituted another meat or plant-based substitute for beef just half the time, that's half as much beef being consumed world-wide. Even on a smaller scale, if just one person does this consistently, that's half as much beef being consumed over an entire lifetime. It is a good reminder that even the seemingly small choices have a large impact on the world around us. It is a good reminder that every effort is ultimately worth it.

<br><br>

The film did a good job balancing the fearsome facts with the optimism of people like astronaut Piers Sellers, who makes a point of anticipating a future beyond his own life. The problem, I think, with even many who accept the reality of climate change, is the sense of pointlessness that is so pervasive among people who know that even if we stop pollution immediately, we will still face consequences from our many years of indiscriminate pollution.While fear is a good motivator for many in producing a change in behavior, we need more optimism as well, because many who understand the reality of the problem do not have a clear solution. 

<br><br>

I appreciated that Di Caprio portrayed the plight of the poor as well. Impoverished people need energy, and do not have access to clean energy the the way that wealthier countries do. Nations like the United States must set an example by relying on clean and sustainable energy and helping other countries transition that way as well.

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, “Before the Flood” is a film showing the physical effects of climate change while also revealing more crucial information through interviews with some of the most prominent people in this generation and fight, including President Obama and Elon Musk. Leonardo DiCaprio uses his wide range of reach to publicize just how severe climate change is, and how it is already directly impacting the earth we inhabit. The film shows the melting glaciers and levelled forests that are already impacting important interconnected ecosystems on earth. This crisis that we, as humans, have brought upon ourselves is the subject of the film, with the ninety minutes showing the worlds impossible dependence on fossil fuels. This shows how far humans will go to keep on living with luxuries, to the point where it is actually destroying the very, and only, place we have to live on. This film shows just how important global warming is and how we need to have a sense of urgency in fighting this. This film approaches this incredibly complicated topic in a way where any common viewer can understand it, which is the beauty of it. Dicaprio admits that he also doesn’t have much knowledge in the beginning of the film, showing that almost anyone can educate themselves on this topic and even make a change. This documentary encourages viewers to be more environmentally- conscious of their actions and take little steps to lessen the impacts one has on global warming. The fact that this film was even made and watched gives me hope, because it shows that many people genuinely care and want to make a change, which is the first step in the process of fighting this climate crisis.

I agree with you that this film gave me hope since there are so many passionate people who want to fix the mess we have created. It still baffles me to my core though that throughout this film they had highly respected people talking about this emergency and there are still people who are quick to brush it to the side. There are so many disbelievers in this crisis that our climate is in. Like Ken asked us, I personally think that Leonardo DiCaprio was a great person to have as the protagonist. Like you said, it gave us a perspective from someone who wasn’t very educated about this subject and was able to learn about this while also being a popular voice as a tactic to interest others. This video can be a tool used to educate others about the severity of this issue, I hope it can become more popular and people really start to listen.

I completely agree with your point on how almost anyone can educate themselves on this topic and even make a change. More and more people are starting to see firsthand the larger storms and increasingly frequent weather crisis (wildfires, floods, drought, etc), furthering the inevitable growth for support of things like eating less meat or using less plastics in a grassroots-like movement. Similarly, I agree with how you mention that we as humans are directly impacting the earth we inhabit, and it is very clear through the documentary "Before the Flood". Just as it was being argued in the film, the world will only take action when it realizes that we as a society stand up for the cause and force the world's leaders to join the movement. In fact, many in the film argued that policies like a carbon tax and greater carbon restrictions would hugely remove the majority of CO2 emissions simply based on basic economic principle. Elon Musk, for example, argued that the Tesla gigafactory was a huge step towards becoming renewable, and with 100 globally it could be done. However, things like policies and lack of proper government support were making it difficult to head in such a direction at the pace needed. Ultimately, I think that it will be our responsibility, as the human race, to take account for our planet's destruction and make a change, something that the film aims to do with Leo's hopeful yet bleak closing statements.

In the documentary, "Before the Flood," Leonardo Dicaprio takes his viewers along on a journey in discovering the international effects of climate change and promotes the different actions we should take. As the introduction began, I was surprised to find Leonardo Dicaprio starring in the documentary because I was not aware of his role in the climate change initiatives. The intention of having a well-known celebrity was most likely to attract attention on the movement, but for me, I was unsure of the content due to my uneasiness of Dicaprio being a credible and reliable source. In fact, his role in the documentary surprised me so much that I googled what he has done presently for climate change. I also kept thinking what a wasted opportunity of sending someone uneducated around the world to interview such high profile impactive leaders with no deeper knowledge on the subject. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, I do believe Dicaprio being as clueless as we, the viewers, made it much easier to understand and watch. I particularly enjoyed his visit in India, and how the woman was already shaking her head no to what he was saying. The way he visited different places around the world helped underscore that this is an international problem and not a single nation’s problem. In addition, it is up to bigger and more developed countries to start the movement rather than focusing on third world countries to make changes. In the film, I like how he visited different situations of the same problem such as the smoggy Beijing, Florida flooding, dying reefs, and etc. Through showing and traveling to all these different places, the movie star showcases how climate change is not as simple as the earth warming but much more catastrophic than that. Lastly, I appreciate how he ended with certain actions that we can support or take part in helping this serious movement.

From the first few seconds of watching Before the Flood, I was hooked. The producers did a great job, from the bat, at touching on the terrifying aspects of climate change to hook the watcher to keep watching. Along with this, Leonardo DiCaprio helps to pull a broader range of watchers, which is crucial in educating as many people as possible of the horrors of climate change. 
<br><br>

I think the film did a fantastic job at teaching about climate change through Leonardo Dicaprio as he helps draw in a broad range of people. Through his learning of climate change, we are also learning about what is going on in our world. I think that through using an influential person in order to shed light on what is happening to our world, one is able to inform more people to take a stand and help become active parts in climate change prevention. 
<br><br>

The movie then goes on to actually show the viewers first hand various effects of climate change and what it has already done to our Earth. The part that shocked me the most was when they were in the North Islands of Canada and you can visibly see how much ice has melted within the last 5 years. The amount of ice that has already melted is way more than I could have ever possibly imagined. The movie continues to show the first hand effects that have been affecting our Earth. By actually showing people what has already happened to our Earth and what could happen in the years to come, they are able to create a domino effect of how people will respond to these issues. I think people will start responding to the way politics is structured around big corporations and how negative an impact it has on our environment. Many of the topics that were discussed in this film were new to me, and I think with more people watching films like these they will take a stand against big corporations. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and hope it encourages people to help climate change in any way they can.

The name of the film comes from one painting which shows the scenario of human beings that are devastating the environment and exploiting the nature. Leonardo used the comparison between the painting and real life, indicating that if human don’t take action, we will end up destroying our homeland and lose everything. This vivid depiction run through the whole movie and concatenate Leonardo’s emphasis of protecting the environment.
<br><br>

I am attracted by Leonardo’s personal travel around the world the most. In the episode of north pole, I learned that climate change melts the ice of north pole, and the melting ice further bring more influence on the whole world because it cannot cool down the temperature of the earth. This would produce a vicious circle significantly. When Leonardo talks about Beijing, China, I feel great empathy because I come from China. Not only Beijing, but also other cities are suffering from industrial pollution. People have to wear a gauze mask and see their hometown wreathed in a gauzy shroud of pollution. Moreover, I am shocked that many leaders of area do not believe that we have a climate change such as the senator of Florida. To restrain the climate change, we need righteous political party instead of being controlled by fossil fuel funded climate change deniers. In summary, different countries in the whole world need to work together toward the goal, with the support of scientists, politicians, and citizens.

When I started watching Before the Flood, I was immediately suspicious. I generally don't trust celebrities when it comes to any kind of political activism. Genuinely, I think class interest comes before all else, and those with power and wealth-- for the most part-- rarely support popular movements and, when they do, often only support them in an aesthetic manner that won't change much about their lives. But I was genuinely, pleasantly surprised by DiCaprio, and dug into his activism further to find a consistent and just activist history. It really makes me wonder what is different about him: why he has championed this cause while others haven't.
<br><br>

It's funny: literally earlier today while browsing Twitter, I saw hordes of people clamoring for DiCaprio to endorse Bernie Sanders. Sunrise Movement had just endorsed Sanders, and people in the comments were @ing DiCaprio, some genuinely wanting him to endorse for the celebrity appeal and others doing so sarcastically, the clear subtext being that no one with that much wealth and power would ever endorse a socialist climate warrior.  
<br><br>

I want to say "but this movie isn't about DiCaprio" and move on, yet... well, looking at this comment and all the others, that's about all we're talking about. This certainly could be because we already know about climate change; that's why we're in this class. We know about sea levels and pumps and disruption and destruction and all else the documentary talks about. But this movie isn't supposed to be about DiCaprio as anything more than a surrogate, yet it is still all we talk about. Is the message diluted by focusing it entirely on this conduit: or is it maybe made that much stronger, since most people quite like the guy? I honestly can't tell.

Very insightful comment Lex! I think the celebrity of DiCaprio is a sort of double-edged sword. On one side, his fame and renown lends a voice to the cause of climate activism and on the other side, it leads to the cause being used as a backdrop for DiCaprio. Several times in the film, Leo is taking these money shots of himself and it does seem like he is inflating his own ego, but I think it is important that we look past that and think about what the people he was talking to were saying. 
<br><br>


For example, the representatives from developing countries that are facing imminent or current damage from climate change seemed to take a more pessimistic view of the crisis compared to the Western leaders who believe we will make it out of the crisis just fine. I personally think this dichotomy of thought should be taken into account because it is easy for those of us in the West to look at this crisis and say everything will be fine (since for us, it will be) at least when compared to a country such as the Maldives, which will be completely submerged if we do not immediately stop burning fossil fuels.

The film, “Before the Flood,” was very well done and extremely intriguing. I think that having Leonardo Dicaprio as the star of the movie was a very tasteful decision to bring in a vast array of audiences. Him being an attractive, successful academy award winning actor while also being a recognized climate activist made this a potentially successful film right off the bat. I really enjoyed that they incorporated not only the success that he has received in the activist community but also the backlash he got. It showed that he was so confident in his findings that he was comfortable being vulnerable with the world and showing his failure. 
 <br><br>

It was very engaging to be able to see physical visuals of the current effects of climate change. When he went to the Arctic and they showed a hose that used to be underground that has now been melted out in less than five years was mesmerizing in a negative manner. In the vast timeline of human existence five years is but a pinpoint. This fact goes to show the alarming rate that the climate is truly changing. To also see the streets of Miami flooding on a sunny day was a perfect example to show the oceans are truly rising. The floods there are not a result of rain but ocean water seeping up through the drains because the ice caps are melting causing the oceans to basically overflow.
<br><br>

 This film is very current and it is hard to imagine that some individuals still do not believe that this is a global crisis created by humans that can still be solved by humans.

I agree with you. The film "Before the Flood" was made very beautifully. Dicaprio gives us a very detailed tour on how climate is changing globally and enhances the images he provide by showing us his interviews. His interviews help us understand that we are still waiting on the worst. One of my favorite interviews was the one he had with Sunita Narain because she reveals how the Indians do not have access to electricity and yet the US is telling them to cut their use of electricity. She also mentions how unfair it is that the US asks for such a think without doing that themselves and how that is just not going to work. It even feels tensed when he responded by saying that the US reducing its emissions is just not going to happen.His dedication to learn the science within is also very admiring. I found it very brave of him to actually visit world leaders since it shows that he deeply cares about the situation.I also truly feel that Dicaprio made this a very successful film.

Before the Flood: Leonardo DiCaprio’s depiction of the tragedies occurring on our planet in “Before the Blood” was completely heartbreaking. What I liked most about the movie was that it showed different ecosystems and people all over the world that are reaping the effects of global warming and human impact. It was heartbreaking to watch glaciers collapsing, intentional fires being burned killing all life there, and severe weather destroying homes. It was even more heartbreaking to watch and learn about the corruption within our politicians and large companies, knowing that their economic interests are more important to them than their own planet. DiCaprio’s film does an amazing job of giving people tips on how to reduce your footprint, whether it be cutting back on beef or not using palm oil, every action has an impact. The urgency DiCaprio expresses really shows how catastrophic of a direction we are headed in. Hopefully more people, like Dicaprio or Musk, use their affluence and wealth to help combat this global issue as soon as possible and demonstrate to politicians what the public wants. 
 <br><br>

I think making DiCaprio as the protagonist is an effective rhetorical device by connecting him more to the people watching the movie. People may be more motivated to act hearing from people they respect and from someone who is not just a scientist or specialist in the matter. DiCaprio’s journey to learn more inspires his audience to also want to learn more about this climate crisis and how they can help.

In watching “Before the Flood,” I experienced many if not all of the emotional responses you have. Although upsetting, I believe this tactic is the only way that will truly make a difference in breaking through people’s ignorance or unwillingness to think deeply about climate change and the terrifying effect it has and will have on our entire planet. Positive reinforcement has proven to be completely useless and ineffective in this matter. The shock tactic of this film and the unfiltered sharing of harsh realities and facts serve to scare viewers into understanding and changing. Personally, learning about the albedo effect allowed me to understand so much more about the effects of climate change in the ice covered regions of the world. Seeing the effects of the palm oil industry on the deforestation issue is purely insane. Half of all the coral in the world being killed within the last 30 years is heartbreaking and worrisome in terms of our ocean’s marine life and ecosystems fate. These facts are impossible to deny any further and watching them happen allows viewers to visualize the rapid approaching destruction of the entire Earth. The politicians and large companies denying the effects of climate change and hiding the severity of their own impact from the public is something that can no longer continue if the Earth is to be saved. This film made it clear to me that we as individuals need to take steps on our own and encourage others like these major power players to make a real change.
<br><br>
I also very much agree with your statement that using Leonardo Dicaprio as a draw in the film is an extremely productive strategy in inspiring people to listen and act on their own. Especially effective is the fact that he is more than a face that people can relate to and admire and is actually a climate and environmental advocist who knows a great deal about the subject at hand.

<p>
Many people who believe that climate change is an issue also want to begin to change their lifestyles. While many others who deny that the issue is happening are the ones who are allowing the destruction of our planet to increase. What I did not understand for the longest time was how people couldn’t believe. Scientists have been telling people for centuries about this issue along with the facts. People know that global temperatures are rising changing climate. Yet denyers like to state that it is supposed to be cold tomorrow, but that is the weather. After watching the film Before the Flood I realized many other reasons people are able to deny the impacts we are causing. This is because major companies like exxon, shell, chevron, and more fund climate denial inorder to stay in business. 
  <br><br>
This film also taught me a very important factor of how much power individuals have. For the longest time I used to say, we need to vote for taxes, elect people who want to help the climate. I knew that each vote mattered, but instead change can happen through our everyday purchases. The film pointed out that politicians will say and do what their people want in order to be voted into office. Therefore a majority of society needs to come together, no matter what party and demand all politicians to run with climate change in mind. People being the main push in all power comes into account in many situations. Another example brought up is with palm oil, which is one of the cheapest oils, but also requires terrible destruction of forests. The film argues that if society refuses to eat or use products containing palm oil manufactoros will need to find a cleaner ingredient. Therefore society once again has the power to make a difference in our actions.

I agree that all politicians will say things just to get votes and to be voted into office. If politicans do happen to lie, then one of the best things we as the people can do is protest and vote. Peaceful but powerful protesting is something that has worked for years. We have young people sacrificing their education, such as Greta Thunberg, in order to make sure the Earth will not burn to pieces and take us with them. If our elders are not willing to make the change, we have to somehow force the change upon them somehow. I am very grateful that someone such as Leonardo is stepping up during this crisis. Through people like him, our voices will be heard!

Prior to viewing the film, Before the Flood, I’ve always known DiCaprio as an outspoken individual for climate change from the speeches he had given in the past when he accepted awards. In the beginning of the film when The Garden of Earthly Delights was introduced, I had assumed that we’re in the last panel, but I’ve learned that we’re currently in the midst of the second panel by the end of the film. This realization brought me hope that we could still fix this situation and abide with the outline of the Paris agreement. The opening of the film also discussed waste products which brought me back to Monday’s lecture when Ken talked about the two solutions to reduce greenhouse gases. Waste products including food have been a critical issue that we constantly overlook because we are so fixated on the idea of being more eco-friendly without understanding the cause of the problem. When DiCaprio asked the question regarding climate change and why it’s overlooked, the answer that he received was that it takes a long time for people to feel it and it seems abstract. However, I believe that it’s much easier to “feel” it now with the constant rise of temperature throughout the year, and it’s really not “abstract” anymore due to all the physical evidence that can be observed everywhere. 
  <br><br>

Seeing the city of Miami flooding as a result of sea level rise, I fear for those who live near water around the globe because there won’t be a future if everything is submerged. Sadly, raising the roads and using electric pumps will only buy Florida another forty to fifty years, officials need to come up with more solutions in an urgent manner because the ocean doesn’t care about politics. I find it disgusting and immoral that corporate interests are denying climate change. I believe that this will be overturned at some point in time with popular opinion regardless of what kind of “facts” they are able to provide to the general public, just like how body image has been controversial for such a long period of time and that Victoria’s Secret finally cancelled their annual fashion show due to a growing demand of respect to female bodies. Knowing that other countries around the world suffer as a result of climate change made me question how we ended up like this, schools being shut down and places where access to energy is a greater challenge than fighting climate change. 
  <br><br>

I hope that carbon tax will be implemented with the objective to make everyone who leaves footprints behind understand that every action has a consequence. I appreciate that the end of the film provided opportunities for us to help reverse what we have created. Personally, I know I will be looking out for leaders who will fight climate change and shifting my diet to a more plant-based one. I pray that we will never enter the last phase of Bosch’s painting where our planet is left ruined and uninhabitable.

Overall, I think that the approach taken in the film “Before the Flood” was effective. While Leonardo DiCaprio is obviously not an average person, he evokes familiarity because of his on-screen presence. So while I was previously unaware of his involvement when it comes to environmental awareness, I agree that he made for a strong host of sorts in the film. Additionally, while I agree that the effects of climate change are less abstract than in previous years, I still believe that it is too far removed for most Americans as well as many other citizens worldwide. This is also partly due to the influence of corparate interests as you discussed. In this sense, I actually believe the two issues are intertwined. The film actually highlighted the influence of corporate interests, whether it was threatening scientists, promoting misinformation, or voting down legislation, in a way that compounded the importance of voicing our opinions as citizens. 
  <br><br>


In the film, DiCaprio references the fact that even politicians like Barack Obama, widely respected and viewed as progressive in many ways, tend to favor sweeping or especially influential policy if it is polling well among their supporters. Effectively, politicians are a function of those who keep them in office whether it is corporations or individuals. To date, it seems that the corporations(especially in the fossil fuel related industries) are still dominating enough of the political and media realms to slow progress to a relative crawl. While I also agree that a carbon tax is a strong step to curbing emissions, I have a hard time believing that an effective carbon tax can be implemented in the current political climate.
<br><hr>
First off, I appreciate your response to my original comment. I want to bring attention to the involvement of corporate interests as you stated. After reading week 2’s article on 2º Beyond the Limit, I realized that financial incentive is everywhere including local business interests in Santa Barbara. While environmentalists are trying to get rid of the parking structures in downtown Santa Barbara due to the astounding rate of greenhouse gas emission from automobiles, local business owners argue that these parking spaces are the source of their income and the reason why customers are willing to visit their shops. As a resident of Santa Barbara, I am torn between the two because I understand the environmental impact of driving, however I also want to be able to use my car to go to a yoga class, a restaurant, and all that Santa Barbara has to offer. In all honesty, parking is a big deal to me. If there is no parking, I probably will not stay, and I will go on to places that have parking lots. 
  <br><br>

With that being said, I acknowledge your concern with the implementation of the carbon tax. If people are unwilling to pay for parking, how are they going to voluntarily pay for a tax that has never been written into the law. I believe that action speaks louder than words. Unfortunately, I am not financially stable enough to perform the action in this case. I hope maybe one day that can change.

An Inconvenient Sequel is based around the former American Vice President, Al Gore, and his continuous, and long fight in the world of the climate crisis. Throughout this film he documents his battle, gaining many other followers, activists to help him influence international climate policy. Al Gore and the many activists are trying to persuade governmental leaders in put their money into renewable energy and to sign the Paris Agreement, which was enacted in 2016. 
  <br><br>

 The film starts out with the many people who doubted and continue to doubt Gore and his environmental work, they say “if its global warming why aren't we looking at the places that had extremely cold winters?” Gore goes to debunk this, educating why we call it climate change instead of global warming. The climate is changing, and this does not mean that it's just going to be slightly warmer everywhere, but there is also going to be many environmental weather disasters. The film goes into talking about all these weather changes, and how because of climate change, natural disasters are going to hit the world more frequently, quicker, harder, and way more destructive. The director tries to get the audience to feel empathy towards the environment by bringing in examples from our own backyard. He describes the devastating flooding in NOLA and NY, making it hit closer to home. This documentary build logos in Gore and the audience feels the need and want to listen to him. This film creates optimism because it shows the audience that there are people who care and what to make positive change for the environment.

As I have previously watched "Before the Flood," I watched "An Inconvenient Sequel."  Watching this film, it is clear that all the effort that Al Gore and so many others are putting into combating the climate crisis.  One part that struck me was all of the work that Gore puts into the communication and education of others on the issue of global climate change.  He has created films, books, travels doing presentations, and teaches others to communicate this urgent issue.  Gore is definitely an inspiration as he continues to charge at the problem despite all of the setbacks and opposition he has received throughout the years.  People like Gore are who we need more of these days, increasing our awareness and knowledge about the issue plaguing our world.  With more education comes more change because people will see the truth, and if we want to preserve this planet for generations to come, then we must make the valuable changes now.  There is no more time to sit around and deny climate change.  The vast effects are being felt around the world and people, animals, plants and more are suffering.  With the education of the public, they will be able to see how vast of a problem climate change is because currently the vast majority of people who can make a difference aren’t as they don’t see the effects in their daily lives.  A good way I like to visualize it is that is carbon dioxide is invisible so people can’t see it and the effects of it are not apparent.  However, if the carbon dioxide were black and people could see it everyday, where it came from, and what effects it was directly connected with, then people would be much more inclined to deal with it.  Therefore, education has to reach the public and establish a connection between the actions of society and the effects of climate change.

An Inconvenient Sequel
  <br><br>
Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Sequel was my favorite film to watch out of all the other previous films I had watched in English 22. Gore immediately mentions and compares his previous film An Inconvenient Truth, as a way to see how his predictions had aged. And he was right about a great many things. What I found most astonishing was when the media started to criticize his demonstration in his first movie of flooding of the 9/11 memorial, and towards the latter half of this film, he shows his prediction coming true. Gore shows footage of water flooding into the 9/11 memorial to further back his point that not only was his first film accurate, but it was dead on for some of the issues climate change could cause. I agree with Ken that Gore’s first film, An Inconvenient Truth, is too old to be able to relate to a lot of the situations that are happening today. However, this is where An Inconvenient Sequel takes over and walks the viewer through the more modern issues like when Gore is debating with the Indian minister of energy, etc. After watching both Before the Flood and An Inconvenient Sequel I preferred Al Gore’s approach to the production of the film. It was very revealing to see all of the “behind the scenes” politics that goes into working on the Paris agreement or even just working together to solve climate change issues. Gore sought to reveal these issues and show the viewer that it is complex but doable to create a positive change in the battle of climate change. De Caprio’s approach of bringing the viewer along as he goes around the world viewing the devastation of climate change I found to be less informative and harder to watch. Gore goes into the issues as to what we can do to stop climate change as well as what it is we’re currently doing to halt the effects of climate change. For instance, when Gore was giving his training seminars about climate change to different communities, he showed a video of his trip to Miami, Florida. During this, he was filmed wading through water halfway up his leg and he also showed the devastation that was caused by this flooding. He spoke to the people in charge of building the massive pumps to get rid of the water in the streets or to even raise the roads higher up. I was glad to see towards the end of the film that Gore was successful in negotiating Solarcity to build more solar panels in India, in order to get everyone to agree on the Paris climate accord. However, when Trump became president, he withdrew the U.S. from that accord. Gore’s film was extremely informative, motivating, and interesting to watch, and it gives the American people as well as others reason to start doing something about the climate change situation we are currently in.

An Inconvenient Sequel (watched Before the Flood in Engl 22) 
<br><br>

I absolutely agree; I also loved Gore’s approach of going “behind the scenes” as he helped the audience walk through his journey of fighting climate change by hosting training seminars, meeting other nations’ leaders, etc. It’s really frustrating to watch how in Gore’s time period, many people believed either that climate change was a hoax, or that their actions of pollution and use of coal wouldn’t damage the Earth’s atmosphere by a large amount. Thus, when Gore became the frontrunner to fighting climate change, many people criticized him and stated that he argues for way too many hyperboles, and never considers when the weather gets too cold. I admired how Gore, despite all the negative and discouraging comments, continues to fight against the climate crisis by visiting places such as Florida and Greenland to reveal to the audience the detrimental impact the climate crisis has brought to our environment.
<br><br>
For example, when Gore visited Swiss Camp, the scientist informs him that since 2000, we have lost 12 meters of ice, and many of the ice ridges along Central Greenland have melted. In Florida, people are desperately trying to pump the water out of the city, but the water is continuing to come from the drains and the manholes. To further underscore this, Gore provides statistics of how the projected sea level could rise by more than 7 feet in South Florida by 2021, and cities such as Mumbai and Guangzhou are at risk. 
<br><br>
I also admire that Gore brought a sense of optimism and positivity into this film. He explains how Scotland is receiving 100% of its electricity from wind, and Portugal went 4 days straight just from renewable energy. In addition, world solar PV installations are rising at an incredible rate. By providing these statistics to the audience, the film becomes more appealing and interesting because Gore provides hope that it is not too late to fight against this global crisis.

I always considered Leonard DiCaprio as a big movie star, and I never thought that he would become a messenger who calls for environmental protection. I was amazed when I saw him appear in the movie Before the Flood. As a united nations messenger of peace, Leonard DiCaprio lead us to different continents of world and witness global warming that happened around the world. He acquires knowledge of climate change from scientists and has interviews with several political leaders. They talk about the current situation of climate change and discuss how to fight against inaction toward this issue. Leonard takes us viewers to different places around the world, so we see what happened exactly through our eyes. The reality is astonishing. Global warming is happening all over the world. No matter in united states, India, or China, global warming becomes a problem which cannot be ignored. The severity is far beyond our imagination. If we don't take actions immediately, the consequence would be more serious.

In “An Inconvenient Sequel”, I enjoyed learning the political side behind the climate crisis. Al Gore faced many barriers as a politician and environmentalist as shown in the movie. I think it's important to recognize his efforts when the political climate we live in today and at the time of the film, was surrounded by many critics of climate change. His approach is important to recognize because it shows how difficult it was to do something with the climate crisis when the poltical cliamte itself is hot. My favorite part of the film was seeing how Al Gore passionately spoke about the crisis at his climate change training. His presentation that showed how Chile was significantly growing in renewable energy was also interesting to learn and see as a step forward in renewable energy. In terms of renewable energy, I found the connection to Santa Barbara, Goleta, and UCSB, as we have made goals to be 100% renewable energy soon. I also appreciated how the film showed the Paris Agreement Conference. The negotiations were interesting to watch as we saw how Gore was helping behind the scenes to get India to agree. His efforts to help negotiate with India was important to discuss because it shows how Gore truly wants what is best for the climate. Although I understood India’s argument in using fossil fuels as a developing country. Overall, I enjoyed seeing “An Inconvenient Sequel” because of its politcal approach.
<br><br>
As I also watched “Before the Flood” in English 22, I’d like to comment that I truly enjoyed the movie as it completely surprised me to see DiCaprio do so much as an environmentalist. I saw that his status of being "just an actor" is what makes his actions that much more important. DiCaprio is making a change and as an actor with the platform he has, he is bringing more awareness from the media and possible fans. My favorite part of Leo's journey was when he spoke about his movie experiences. He used his movie experiences as metaphors and wake up calls for what is really happening. In a movie, a script of what is written can be controlled. Our current climate crisis is writing itself and cannot be rewritten. I think this metaphor was powerful because it shows how action must be done quickly before its too late. DiCaprio's efforts to speak with many higher figures such as President Obama and the Pope displays how wide and important the crisis is to Leo and the whole world. Leo's discussion with the Pope surprised me because like Leo said, for the Pope to acknowledge that there is a climate crisis, means that action must be done. It opened my eyes because the Pope that Leo spoke to is acknowledging that the science that presents the crisis is correct, something that no Pope has ever acknowledged.. Leo being able to step out and speak as the UN Messenger of Peace, and go on journeys to bring awareness, shows how important it is to do something about the crisis even if it seems to not be apart of your "lane".

Despite being a young person who is not usually interested in political affairs, I thoroughly enjoyed “An Inconvenient Sequel.” It was fulfilling to learn about the political aspect of the climate crisis.

<br><br>

In reference to your comment, I appreciated the connection that you made to Santa Barbara, Goleta, and UCSB’s efforts to mitigate the climate crisis. It is gratifying to know that our town is making an effort towards a sustainable future. 

<br><br>

Although Al Gore was able to present a few issues at the beginning of the climate change training conference shown in the film, I thought it was unjust how he was constantly interrupted from thereon out. He was never able to openly state his opinions on the matter and was always cut off before getting the chance to answer the press’ questions. At the time of the film’s creation in 2017, climate change was rarely acknowledged and if you addressed the climate crisis in any way, you would be ridiculed. For this reason, I believe Al Gore deserves support and recognition for defending his beliefs.

I found “Before the Flood” to be a very eye-opening and informative documentary. This film was more relatable because it was through Leonardo DiCaprio’s eyes, who was trying to become more informed on the Climate Crisis just like us viewers. He’s not a scientist spewing facts at us, but rather a famous actor who most of us respect. Seeing the effects of climate change through pictures and film definitely impacted me more than reading an article, and it made me want to help take action.

<br><br>

Another piece of this film that I related to was President Obama describing his desire for his kids to see glaciers in Alaska the way he did. I’ve been to Alaska three times, and each time I’ve visited Hubbard Glacier. With every visit, the glacier is visibly smaller. I’ve seen the effects of climate change first-hand, and it’s devastating to think that the next time I visit Alaska, Hubbard Glacier might be non-existent. It’s the harsh reality that we face because people aren’t taking action.
<br><br>


I think one of the most interesting points made in the film was about China. China is making strides towards cutting down fossil fuels because the people believe that climate change is happening and are concerned about its effects. They have this concern because climate change is affecting their everyday lives through the poor air quality and intense smog. We in America do not experience the impacts of climate change as much as the people in China do, thus our lack of urgency for making changes. As DiCaprio stated, “we can’t pretend that we know how this is going to end. The only thing we can do is control what we do next. How we live our lives. What we consume. And how we get involved.”

I was surprised to be shocked at the content of “Before The Flood”. I had prided myself into being knowledgeable on climate change but had no idea the extent of how deep we as the human race are in the hole. I greatly appreciated the many views and resources that the movie had to offer and respected Leonardo Dicaprio as I have been following his work as a climate change activist. Being able to actually see the effects all over the world and not only in the United States was unique to the research that is usually presented on my social media. I was very interested in seeing how other countries around the world address the climate change issue and the changes they are making in their own governments to halt their own contributions to the growing problem. Another interesting perspective that was offered in the film was showing the politics behind climate change in the United States specifically and showcasing ways to positively affect policy. The promotion of a carbon tax is now something I value greatly and hope to see in the future. I also found Leonardo DiCaprio and Elon Musk talking to be extremely significant in showcasing an plausible way to get the United States to be sustainable. 
 <br><br>
I think that you have a great point when she claims that having Leonardo DiCario in the film contributes greatly to the fact that the film does not feel like the viewers are watching many different scientific studies but a true documentary. His methods and previous experience as an actor allows for the presentation of the information to be casual but nonetheless still quite informative. Additionally, this also impacted me more than the article since seeing the physical effects had more of a concrete influence. The article was still impactful, but the film did an amazing job of showing the seriousness of the situation as well as ways to help without making it seem impossible. I wish I was able to see the glaciers in Alaska, but I can still relate since watching the film allowed me to see their beauty and importance beyond aesthetics. I, like Obama and Sydney, desire for my kids to be able to see the world in the same way I did with wildlife and the beauty of nature. In addition, I also found China as one of the most impactful parts of the film. Seeing the way that they have to live their everyday lives with masks and other factors. This was a rude awakening to our near future. Seeing the precautions they are attempting to take to prevent even more damage shows how the United States is in a very difficult spot.

Though I haven't seen Gore's first documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth" I found his "An Inconvenient Sequel" to have a generally uplifting tone in the sense that along with focusing on the dire effects of climate change, he strives to create change not only in the United States, but within other countries. There were a few aspects of the film which I felt were the most impactful and provided first-hand evidence of extreme consquences that were happening in 2016, and are still happening today at even faster and more severe pace. When Gore visits Greenland and witnesses the results of the perpetually melting ice sheets, the viewer is able to see the sheer magnitude and rate at which glaciers and ice that are home to so many different species are dissapearing, an image that is deeply unsettling. However, I felt that an even more terrifying aspect of the film came when Gore travels to Miami for one of his climate leadership trainings. As he reveals that Miami is the number one at-risk city in the world for sea level rise as clips of completely flooded streets complete with fish swimming through the murky waters is presented, its difficult not to feel alarmed at the fact that Miami may soon be underwater. It's important that Gore draws attention to this as not only are parts of the United States flooding on a regular basis, but entire nations are at extreme risk of being completely submerged, leaving millions without homes, or the necessary resources to provide for their families. Similarly, in talking about the effects of rising temperatures in places such as Pakistan, it is revealed that mass graves are being dug in advance to prepare for the potential numerous deaths that may occur due to the extremely high and therefore lethal temperatures. Though there are many examples of the ways in which climate change has led to death and severe danger, Gore decides to end the film with the Paris agreement, and the successful role he plays in negotiating with India to adopt more renewable energy systems rather than coal plants. I feel that ending on a positive note such as this is effective in the sense that he provides the viewers with evidence that if a developing country such as India can adopt policies to shift to more renewable energy sources, than the United States must do more to set an example for other nations, and be rid of its current addiction to fossil fuels.

Film(Before the Flood)- I think this film is very important in helping Climate Change decrease  and making more people aware of climate change. At the beginning of the film many people question if Leonardo Dicaprio is the right man for the U.N messenger of peace. He receives a lot of backlash from many people including FOX news. I believe that the appointment of Leonardo Dicaprio is good because celebrities are standing up for an important and ongoing issue, which makes more people aware of the issue through their fanbase. Leonardo Dicaprio is the main protagonist, where he takes the viewers along with him as he begins a journey on why climate change is increasing each year. I think Leonardo does a great job in not being very negative throughout the film. He shows that climate change is real and it is affecting us rapidly, but he highlights that there are solutions which can be short term and long term. This was important to me because as the viewer you want to help make a change and by leonardo providing us with short term and long term solution you really want to take advantage of it and start helping the earth. One of the changes that citizens could make is to change their diet. The film explains that the cattle industry is a massive polluter and if people eliminated beef from their diet a significant portion of that pollution would be gone. This has influenced me to try and eliminate meat from diet and start to be more plant based. This film has influenced me to change the way I do things and the way I treat everyday life for the better of the earth.

Before The Flood: This film had an excellent way of making the viewers feel at ease with learning about global warming. I appreciated having Leonardo DiCaprio to relate to on an issue like this. I think Leonardo DiCaprio was a great choice for Before the Flood, mainly due to the fact that he is so largely in the public eye already. Its significantly easier for the audience to feel more willing to receive information when they are able to relate to the person guiding them. Leo isn't a so-called "expert" in environmental problems obviously, but his willingness to learn and keep an open mind helps to lead us in the correct direction. So even though he's not an expert, I believe he's capable of leading a great movement towards combating climate change. I think just the fact that he's devoted so much of his time to raising awareness to our climate crisis is incredible, and it also takes a lot of guts. Many people surely bash him for his avid support for environmental awareness, but the fact that he continues to show support while receiving mass amounts of hate is admirable.

The film “Before the Flood”, National Geographic and Leonardo DeCaprio honestly and sincerely reveal the true aspects of climate change from a first hand perspective. From horrifying images to personal tragedies of individuals as a result of climate change, the film covers the various communities affected by this phenomenon. One scene that genuinely stood out to me was when in India they showed how half a year’s worth of rain fell in five hours and ruined the entire season’s crop of a man that worked so hard to cultivate it. 
<br><br>
I agree with your point about the fact that by using Leonardo DeCaprio as a messenger about the perils of climate change, the audience becomes more receptive to the message. The fact is that few people are climate scientists and few could claim they have a full understanding of what is happening. By following Leonardo DeCacaprio’s open mind approach, this film successfully reveals the multiple facets of climate change in a comprehensible way. It’s a very poignant film and because of that characteristic, I think it has a greater impact on the audience. Leonardo DeCaprio himself admits that he grew up in Hollywood and that he didn’t hear about climate change until he reached his twenties. He serves as a great example of the fact that people can be informed no matter what their age or their occupation. He uses his fame to spread an important message because he has the resources and the ability to do so, as you mentioned.

Before the Flood: This film was able to successfully portray the effects of climate change in an engaging way. It was interesting to see Leonardo DiCaprio travel the world to learn more about climate change during the film. As DiCaprio traveled, he appeared to put on a front that he lacked knowledge about the climate crisis. Whether this was acting or not, it was an efficient way to connect to his audience because viewers were most likely people who also wanted to expand their knowledge on the subject. While watching this film, an individual who wants to educate themselves and become more environmentally conscious would not feel like they are making the step alone. For this reason, I would recommend this film to friends and family.
<br><br>


I felt held accountable for the daily actions I take and how they affect the planet after watching this film. While watching, I felt as if there were so many parts of my daily life that I not only took for granted, but could also change in order to lessen my environmental footprint. For instance, Dr. Sunita Narain directly challenged Americans to lessen their consumption:  “electricity consumed by 1 American at home is equivalent to .. 61 of Nigeria” (Before the Flood). Watching the people living without electricity in India made me realize how much excess materials and resources we waste in American society. Yet, watching the film also made me realize that it is possible to make lifestyle changes to live a more sustainable way. This was demonstrated in part by China, as they have made the switch to solar and wind power far quicker than anticipated. Watching this film also reminded me why it is so important to vote. The drastic change that the U.S. needs comes from those with power. It is our job, as citizens, to fight to make sure that power is given to those who will prioritize the environment over large fossil fuel companies.

I think the documentary "Before the Flood" was an engaging way to present the facts from many different perspectives: scientists, politicians, entrepreneurs, and more. I believe that Leonardo DiCaprio’s façade of not knowing the facts actually helped the audience understand the film more. It makes the audience feel like they’re learning with someone who is famous, an influencer, and it gives the message across that every person needs to change their actions, not just a select few.

"Before the Flood'' is an incredibly executed documentary presenting the world's climate consequences that all of us are not aware of. Leonardo Dicaprio, the United Nations Messenger of Peace narrates and documents the condition carbon emissions leave the environment in. The film starts by showing the retaliation Dicaprio faces for voicing his opinion on this topic by big news channels. A man who has traveled the world to talk to scientists and experts about global warming for a great part of his life is called 'delusional' by news anchors and is met with people who deny human activity is causing climate change. People believe what they want to believe. One particular segment that caught my attention was when  Dicaprio visits the Canadian Arctic to speak with an arctic guide to find answers in regard to the sea ice. The guide explains how the ice was once blue and is now like "ice cream". This part was sad to me because the Earth is getting worse faster than we think it is. Throughout the documentary, one can acknowledge that Dicaprio has been an active environmentalist for much of his life. Dicaprio exposes the fossil fuel companies for using front groups to portray fake statistics about temperature rises. Important political figures actively discredit scientists for their own interests and attempt to shut down any change mankind's need to make to save the Earth. 
<br><br>
Although the U.S is a major contributor polluter, China takes the crown in this competition. China is responsible for manufacturing for all the Western countries; it comes to no surprise why it is the number one polluter. However, the Chinese government has introduced an environmental policy enforcing laws and regulations on production and industrial sites. 
<br><br>


Let's be frank with ourselves, the lifestyle and consumption habits we have are also leaving carbon footprints on Earth. Americans are a 'fossil addicted' society; we use the most power compared to any country. As an American citizen, I believe we are obligated to set an example for the world. It is truly heartbreaking to see third world countries who lack basic human resources while the United States lives without restrictions. Another thing I learned was that cows produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. The beef industry does not help with this problem nor does our beef diet. Switching to a chicken diet can help reduce by 80% of the greenhouse emissions we emit. Besides this, Dicaprio speaks with a Harvard economics professor who introduces the idea of a carbon tax. Basically, every time an individuals uses or consumes something that emits carbon, he/she should be taxed thus raising the prices of everyday things. 

<br><br>

While the U.S government continues to deny the existence of global warming, the Swedish government has implemented a policy to cut its reliance on fossil fuels and instead use renewable sources. A massive change in attitude in the U.S must be made. Leonardo Dicaprio has shown the audience the measures we can take as mankind to make a change. It is now up to all of us to leave our interests behind.

Ken's lecture gives an important message. Politics do not want to grasp the truth. In a world where money and power are of extreme importance, one can deduce the reasons why politics choose to promote anti-environmentalist propaganda.

“Politics do not want to grasp the truth” that is very true because as long as they don’t admit to it, their constituents or followers will have no reason to believe it or do anything about it. I enjoyed reading your response. I also thought it was interesting to see DiCaprio continue his environmental activism despite the media tearing him down claiming climate change is a hoax or discrediting him by saying he’s just a Hollywood star. 
<br><br>
What caught my attention were the images of the forests on fire, they left me heartbroken. I know it because of us they happen as you said, Americans are addicted to fossils. We are the ones that want our fast food along with cheap food and products. I have been eating less meat, and I think the idea of relying on chicken would be a better compromise for people who eat a form of meat daily. 
<br><br>

I agree politicians are discrediting scientists and other activists for their selfish interests. They said they could not get any of their climate bills passed through Congress because it is controlled by “fossil fuel funded climate change deniers” (27:20). I feel like some may understand that the environmental crisis is real but turn a blind eye on it or deny because they receive too much money to do anything. I believe Sunita was right to say that Americans like to preach about being environmentally friendly with things like solar energy, but they have not done it themselves. Like Ken said in the lecture, U.S. likes to point fingers to third world countries about reducing their waste when one American uses enough for multiple people from those countries. The U.S. always wants to be the leader in many situations and take charge. We should make changes in our energy consumption, so other countries will see that it is possible if one of the top emitters of greenhouse gases did it. As DiCaprio said, we need to lead by example.

Before the Flood is an effective piece of film in that it helps connect the common person with the challenges faced in climate change. Unexpectedly, celebrity actor Leonardo DiCaprio humanizes the issue of climate change. Unlike climate scientists, DiCaprio does not know many of the details of the problems we face or will face in the future. As a figure many people realize, the film is able to engage the audience to learn along with Leonardo DiCaprio on his journey of discovery. 
<br><br>
I have seen others criticize Leonardo DiCaprio on the internet for not truly believing in what he represents. They have pointed out his lifestyle has a larger carbon footprint than the average human. Some also proclaim that he is simply doing this for more attention and fame. However, I think what he is doing is greatly beneficial for combating climate change. Using his platform, especially in this relatable way, to educate about climate change greatly outweighs the comparably higher carbon footprint he produces. 
<br><br>
A part of the film I greatly enjoyed was how critical it was of America’s inaction. The information about United States politicians working with fossil fuel interests was both shocking yet unsurprising. How could these representatives that should be acting in the interest of their constituents be doing such a disservice to the American population? In addition, the film focused on American hypocrisy of focusing on India for producing more fossil fuel emissions, while simultaneously refusing to better themselves. Even China, known for the terrible air conditions has shown vast improvements over the years, attempting to move toward renewable energy. While many other countries, like Sweden and Denmark are moving towards 100% renewable energy, the United States fails to make significant progress, or even regresses by pulling out of the Paris agreement.
<br><br>
Overall, I thought the film did a good job of achieving its goal: informing the public of the issues created by climate change. It presents the challenges in a way that is relatable to the common public, as a nonexpert attempts to learn more about climate change. Though it may not be completely truthful in regards to DiCaprio’s lack of climate change knowledge, it provides an engaging and provoking story for the audience. DiCaprio’s travels from the US to India to South America and to the North Pole provide a great foundation for this.

Using a very appealing and attractive way, "Before the Flood" captures the horror of climate change through the eyes of Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio, even while serving as a UN ambassador and having talked about climate change for several years, takes the documentary from the average viewer's perspective--one that needs the basic introduction into the different horrors and devastation that climate change is causing. Presenting the documentary with DiCaprio as the main star also attracts more viewers to the documentary and raising awareness about climate change.
<br><br>
The film itself if visually stunning, capturing the awestruck moments and landscapes that DiCaprio witnesses across the globe. No longer just contained on paper or in text, the documentary brings the consequences of climate change to life by filming the active destruction of forests in Indonesia, production of tar sands in Canada, and flooding of Pacific islands to those who are not there to witness the situation themselves. It also uses the prominence and influence of important figures well. DiCaprio interviewed Vice President Al Gore, President Barack Obama, Pope Francis, and so on, to provide a clearer sense of the issue of climate change, unclouded by political leanings, religious differences, and cultural differences. It, while produced by US filmmakers, surprisingly attacks the US quite often, and does not censor it.
<br><br>
It is a well known fact that the US is the biggest consumer of resources and one of the biggest polluters (not just in terms of gaseous waste), however, much of the country refuses to acknowledge it. I think it is impactful to include this fact in "Before the Flood" and make more Americans aware of this fact. However, it also presented a very realistic and difficult task that countries have struggled with since the publication of the documentary in 2016, which is that governmental policies also need to acknowledge and favor policies that will help climate change, instead of favoring corporate interests.

<p>
When I was first watching the beginning of the film Before the Flood I was confused as to why Leonardo DiCaprio was appointed as the U.N ambassador of Peace and understood why even he stated that he was worried that they had chosen the wrong guy. However, because Leonardo DiCaprio chose to approach this position and topic as not a scientist or a specialist in the field it made me relate to him in that way and by the end of the film I changed my point of view and even think that he has made a pretty good ambassador especially since he has influence over many people. It made me feel as if I could also educate myself and make a difference. His approach to me was effective because it made me want to lessen my carbon footprint by making differences in my life such as changing such as changing my eating habits, which is not hard for me to do.
<br><br>
This film made me realize how much influence and corrupt the head of large fuel companies are and the power they hold over other countries and our own government in making it seem as though climate change was not a real thing. This film was very compelling to me especially when they were visiting the ice caps and seeing how rapidly they were melting as well as showing how much resources and land the beef industry uses.
<br><br>
 I definitely enjoyed this film and would recommend it to someone just so they could understand the dimensions of this crisis because I think this film made it pretty clear and it was easy to understand and follow along.

I agree with your sentiments towards Dicaprio. When I first saw him being appointed, I thought that he was playing the guy who was actually appointed. It was a funny realization that he was actually the chair for the UN. However, I really liked his approach to presenting climate change. Due to all of his experience in Hollywood, he was able to convert a very dense issue into a format that is appealing to the general public and especially to a younger audience like ourselves. The way that he parallelled all of the factual scientific info and expert testimonies with the story of the painting was very poetic and interesting. To me, it was reminiscent of some of his other films such as Inception where he starts with the story of the old man and ends with the old man. By including elements of pop culture in this portrayal of climate change, he can more easily convince this next generation that climate change is a problem that needs addressing immediately.
<br><br>


Additionally, I was also shocked to learn how extensive the corruption in the food industry is. For me, a big shock was that many of the chips and snacks that I thought were not necessarily as terrible for the planet as a burger are indeed made of palm tree oil. Seeing that diagram with all of the logos and all of the fronts these companies use to mask the dark roots of palm tree oil was definitely eye-opening. Overall, I will try to keep a sharper eye towards where my food is being sourced from. This film has motivated me to keep trying to maintain my Mediterranean diet, but to try to source my food from sustainable sources.

<br><br>

It is a shame that this film does not have more publicity, even with the exposure it gets from DiCaprio. I think that companies like Netflix should do a better job of advertising it in people's recommendations because I did not know of its existence and wish that I and many more people saw it sooner.

After watching the lecture and film An Inconvenient Sequel, I too agree with the fact that some people choose to ignore or deny the truth rather than face the harsh reality of the climate situation. Although the source of some denial stems from peoples political groundings, others simply remain misinformed or uneducated on the topic. I also found it interesting how both Leonardo DiCaprio and Al Gore faced criticism concerning their credibility in the field. While both these figures may not be scientists, they are well informed on the subject matter and have both made extensive impacts on the public’s perspective on climate change. 
<br><br>
I found the film An Inconvenient Sequel to be effective in communicating its message and thought it successfully engaged viewers through showing developments being made to address the issue, specifically by Al Gore. While I aimed to keep an open mind while watching the film, I couldn't help but anticipate how the United States would ultimately withdraw their participation in the Paris agreement under Trump’s presidency. Despite many negotiations and lengths Al Gore went to, many of these were unfortunately undermined with Trumps election and subsequent appointments to the cabinet. I also found it interesting how Al Gore admitted how the politics of climate change involving ‘big money’ corporations was largely to blame for the lack of action on the issue and how these corporations even contributed to the corruption within our democracy. 
<br><br>
While watching this film I found several things to be startling. Although I was already aware of the record temperatures taking place worldwide, I had not yet seen some of the images presented in the film. More specifically I found the amount of ice that melted within just a season at the Swiss Camp station to be particularly shocking as well as the images of the melted roads in India. Not only this but the film goes on to point out how rising temperatures have offset the balance of countless other processes and ecological relationships. 
<br><br>
Overall I found this film to be informative and inspiring. I think the passion with which Al Gore speaks and his commitment to the issue makes it plainly evident that an urgency exists to make real changes to address the climate crisis.

Al Gore confronts the harsh truth of our planet's state to alarm the public of how urgent the issue is. Knowing information isn't as impactful as seeing the destruction taking place. I was struck too, by the melting of the ice caps and the measurements of the glaciers over thirty years ago. Gore's devotion to climate change is truly inspiring and his efforts have helped initiate the environmentalist movement decades ago. However, one point that was mentioned during the Paris Agreement was that, unfortunately, a worldwide problem is in the hands of so few. We need to be responsible for the emissions that we've contributed for a short-lived convenient life. While there is no "world police" it's difficult to hold ourselves accountable to the goal of the Paris Agreement. The stories of China's new approach to sustainable energy as well as Texas are inspiring. While it helps, it doesn't take a politician to initiate these changes. Local governments can progress on their own, educating their people in the process. The united power of people can be stronger than those who stand in the way of change and a sustainable future, which appeared to be the message of "An Inconvenient Sequel."

I agree with your idea about the film “Before the Flood. This film takes us to visit countries all around the world, which is exciting and convincing. Even though most people have realized how serious the climate crisis is, they still ignore the negative effect and continue to hurt the planet. As you have said, people like Leonardo DiCaprio are the one who make efforts to protect the environment by raising an alarm for the public, but he has received more criticism than those who damage the planet. This is kind of irony.

After watching “Before the Flood”, I realized that the true threat of climate change makes me extremely concerned about the future, especially after I learned about deforestation in Indonesia, clear cut oil sands in Canada and the fact that we will be able to sail over the North Pole in the summer in 2040. I was most distraught after learning about the various positive feedback mechanisms that amplify the devastating impacts of climate change, such as the methane trapped in permafrost. Though the truth makes me pessimistic about the future, it also makes me feel compelled to change my lifestyle and encourage others around me to do the same. I understand that people may not want to know the truth since ignorance is bliss, however, it is selfish to isolate oneself from the true threat of climate change and expect others to take action or bear the effects. 
<br><br>


I was irritated to learn that Florida was building pumps and seawalls to adapt to the impacts of climate change, namely sea-level rise. This is a short term solution and does not get close to the root of the issue. Instead of investing in technologies to adapt to climate change, we need to focus on how to mitigate climate change. This may include investments in renewable energy sources or even gigafactories! I was taken aback to learn that India and China are both doing more investment in solar energy than the United States. Moreover, people in the United States need to change their addiction to fossil fuels, their lifestyle of consumption and their meat-heavy diets. 
<br><br>


I was moved by the section of the documentary that focused on the small islands that contribute the least to climate change, yet feel the worst impacts. At the beginning of the documentary, the producers discussed the effects of sea-level rise in affluent areas, such as Miami, Boston, and Long Beach, but the impacts on these areas pale in comparison to the impacts faced by many smaller developing countries. For instance, in 2017, Hurricane Irma hit both the developing Caribbean Island of Barbuda. Florida managed to successfully evacuate its residents due to a stable infrastructure: with freeways that can be converted into evacuation routes and pre-existing building codes along with about 17,000 members of the US National Guard. On the other hand, many citizens of Barbuda did not have the same resources or infrastructure and were trapped on the island with only rooftop rescues to escape the devastation, while more than 95% of Barbuda’s homes were destroyed! We all (especially those with resources) need to recognize the scope of the climate crisis and take action.

The film "Before the Flood" reminded me of the planet I live on and how our actions have been rapidly increasing our likelihood of a mass extinction. Using Leonardo DeCaprio in this documentary was an interesting take on pushing the idea of global warming. DeCaprio is an actor, not a scientist, and for him to be pushing the idea of global warming to us is not as credible as from hearing from a scientist. But after watching this documentary, I've come to realize that seeing someone who is advocating an issue outside of his field, sometimes it is a wake up call that people like DeCaprio are aware of the issue that is at hand. Global warming.
<br><br>


The scene that shocked me most in the movie was when Leonardo DeCaprio was taken to see a machine in the snow, one of the scientists said that the hose use to go straight down underground. When DeCaprio and him held the hose stretched, it stretch out to be 30 feet! 30 feet underground, in the snow, but now the hose is all on the surface. That is how much ice has melted in such a short period of time.

Having a famous actor of DeCaprio's caliber was certainly unexpected for a film about the concerning impacts of climate change. While not as credible as you mentioned, DeCaprio plays the role of someone viewers can relate to in terms of not being a complete expert on the scientific research and data regarding climate change. I don't know if casting DeCaprio for the film's main role was effective in drawing attention to the issue of climate change, but I agree with the sentiment that anything and everything needs to be and should be done to prevent a mass extinction. 
<br><br>

The extent of melted snow was truly astonishing, but I think it's even crazier to think that at such a rate, all the snow and ice near the poles will eventually melt in the absence of substantial action against the climate crisis.

Before The Flood:<br><br>

The film starring Leonardo Dicaprio was very interesting and I found to be very useful in that it places a well-recognized actor in a role we are able to relate to, that of someone interested but not entirely educated on the issue of climate change. What I enjoyed most about the content of this movie is that it skims through the many aspects of climate change; it’s causes and negative impacts while at the same time managing to hold everyone responsible. While I’ve watched a good amount of films pertaining to the issue of climate change, Stevens perspective was quite refreshing in that he did not focus on finding or “placing blame” on a specific group of people and instead offered various solutions through the eye’s of Dicaprio and the many viewpoints of those he held conversations with.

<br><br>

There were definitely two parts of the film that stood out to me the most. The first being Dicaprio’s meeting with Indian environmentalist, Sunita Narain in which they discuss the opportunity of India pushing towards sustainable energy. In this conversation Dicaprio positioned himself as believing that India has the power to be a country that primarily consumes sustainable energy as it becomes available for the first time to this country which already lacks many resources. Narain, agrees with Dicaprio in that climate change is an issue and India would be able to play a role in favor of sustainability but argues that it is unfortunately not the cheapest option and her main concern is allowing people the resource to begin with. I found myself agreeing with both perspectives but also felt as though at one point they were arguing about who should be the “bigger person” and go about being a leader and turning to sustainable resources. Dicaprio’s point was that it is difficult to change people who already have habits in place and Narain explained that her country needs energy now not an expensive alternative “later”.
<br><br>


The second part of the film that intrigued me most was the topic of climate migration. Although, rising sea levels are an aspect of climate change I had heard of before, I had not taken much time to think about how it is it affects more than just America. It was definitely upsetting to hear Anote Tong speak about how it is his island is likely to be flooded and because of it migration of it’s citizens is the “solution” they must turn to. Climate migration overall isn’t something I had ever considered to be a problem, knowing this I am even more frustrated with how it is we consume, specifically us as being knowledgable on this issue.



</p><hr>

<p>
I watched Before the Flood and I found it to be very informative and made me very inspired to change my daily habits. A couple being to choose meats like chicken or turkey compared to beef because beef is one the main sources of methane released into our atmosphere. Something that was very interesting to me was how negatively involved our political leaders are with the climate crisis. I was very surprised to see how much politicians actually denied that climate change was even a thing. They did not believe that there is a serious problem that has a direct correlation to human activity and therefore we don’t have to worry about it. The audience later learns that many of these same politicians are involved and making money in the companies that depend on fossil fuels such as Shell. This climate denial is a serious problem because how are we as a country ever to make changes if half of congress believes it is a hoax. The thing that surprised me the most was to learn that countries in Europe are way ahead of us as far as using more renewable energy. I was in awe that Sweden was already 100% fossil fuel free. The saddest part was that the countries that contribute the least to climate change, are the ones that are experiencing the harshest side effects. The president of Kiribati described that he had bought a whole island to migrate his people due to the threat of the island being submerged underwater. This is truly devastating and it has become so apparent that the US need to seriously step up their game.

The choice to make this film around DiCaprio was an interesting one. Although casting Dicaprio certainly gave the film more popularity, the choice may have traded off with how seriously it was taken. And, from my perspective, it was a good choice. That is not to say there isn’t value in making a movie more scientifically advanced, but to my knowledge there are many films that do take this approach. DiCaprio, rather than purely informing us and telling us how to think, he attempts to ask the questions that everyday people would have about the issue. This makes a lot of sense to me because anyone who is educated on the issue of climate change is aware of the threat, however, the people that most need to be convinced are those who have little to no education on the issue. I think DiCaprio’s name value might bring people to see the movie who may be less educated on the topic. I think based on the intended audience, it makes sense that DiCaprio makes the film more of an overview of various issues regarding climate change rather than going really deep into one. However, even in a movie emphasizing breadth over depth, I still found myself learning some very interesting facts. For example, I always had the notion that India and China were the ones who were choosing to ignore the issue of climate change and that even the US was doing a better job than them. However, it surprised me to see that countries that are currently in the “industrialization” phase of development (generally categorized by an intense focus on manufacturing and generally very little regulation) is doing more for the climate than a “post-industrial” nation, like the US. Even China, a country that is certainly doing its fair share of immoral acts, is aware of the issue at hand and the urgency of it. This highlights the power of money in politics and how absolutely corrupt our congress is. Without knowing a single other thing about congress, someone could look at the various special interests that pay them and they’d be able to tell with near absolute certainty how they’d vote on any given issue. Another thing I learned from this film is how long we’ve known about this issue. Part of me kind of let the world off the hook a bit for not acting faster because I thought that this issue was only recently discovered. However, the film showed that scientists knew about this issue as early as 1958! If we had listened back then, we wouldn’t be doing “Damage control” instead we would’ve completely avoided the issue altogether. I did a bit of research on the topic and I think a carbon tax would be a really good option. Synapse Energy Economics Study in 2014 found that a US carbon tax would reduce US CO2 emissions by 52% by 2035.  And according to the EPA in 2014, the US makes up 16% of global emissions. Thus, by decreasing US emissions by 52%, a carbon tax would reduce global emissions by over 8.3%. This shows the massive impact the US could have just by enacting ONE piece of legislation. Although not likely, it is encouraging to see republicans like the Harvard professor in the video encouraging the US to adopt such a policy.

I completely agree; I believe the choice to make DiCaprio the face of "Before the Flood" brought about more attention to the film and the issue. Before watching this film I didn't realize how invested he was on this issue, and I honestly was irritated with the thought of a celebrity preaching to the public about actions that need to be taken since most celebrities lead lavish, extravagant lives and most definitely have a greater carbon footprint than the general world population. Yet the film was in no way preachy, and DiCaprio asked questions to politicians and scientists that the public would not know off the top of their head. More complex concepts, such as positive feedback loops and how the melting of Greenland will decrease reflecting capabilities and warm the Earth even greater, were explained clearly and shocked me. There are numerous consequences to climate change beyond sea-level rise and higher temperatures, and this film did a wonderful job of bringing them to light. The segment on air pollution in China showcases a tangible, horrific effect climate change has on people, and it's happening this very moment. The film also mentions ways for consumers to make a bigger impact by boycotting (or at least, attempting) palm oil and major corporations that deforest entire ecosystems for palm oil, although it is incredibly difficult to do so, especially in the United States and more developed countries. I also appreciated the political implications that were brought up, and I applaud DiCaprio for asking politicians why legislation cannot be put in place sooner, or why politicians have failed us in the past.

Film: Before the Flood
 <br><br>
The film “Before the Flood” is an eye opening and thought provoking film that sheds light on the climate crisis we are currently undergoing. Leonardo DiCaprio’s work does an excellent job of raising awareness by showing that one does not have to be a scientist to acknowledge that we are harming the environment and should take action before it’s too late. 
 <br><br>
In the film DiCaprio has a conversation with Sunita Narain in which she mentions that if India and other undeveloped countries are taking action to reduce their carbon footprint then why can’t the U.S. do the same? Considering that we are a leading emitter of CO2 I think she made a great point by asking this question. The film then answers her question when politicians who don’t believe in climate change are mentioned. These politicians are preventing laws from being made to help with global warming.  With more laws and regulations it would be mandatory for people and corporations to follow guidelines that would help reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. I find it insane how people who are in denial about climate change are allowed to hold positions of power in congress. 
<br><br>
I agree with Ken’s lecture as many people refuse to want to know more about the climate crisis. This can be due to a variety of reasons such as fear or not wanting to give up the lifestyle they are currently living. Many people simply don’t care because they are not the ones experiencing the effects of climate change on the planet such as hurricanes, flooding, fires, and drought. Just because it is not happening to us doesn’t mean we shouldn’t educate ourselves about the crisis and try to do our part by helping.

Yes, I agree with you about how Sunita Narain calls out Americans for not doing more to lead the world in combating climate change. We produce the most carbon dioxide in the world and yet we are not investing in clean renewable energy. We criticize developing nations for “making the same mistakes” we did when we industrialized. This is a mistake because we ourselves have yet to make the switch to fully cutting carbon emissions. How can we expect poor countries to do the switch before we do. Americans live a lavish lifestyle full of consumerism and that is something we value deeply, but we must start this change and recognize that other nations will follow if we show them how. We must invest more in renewable energy 
  <br><br>
Elon Musk has created the world's largest building for his gigafactories to build batteries for cars. He states that it would only take 100 other factories to make the whole world make the switch to renewable energy. It would make it easier for developing nations to switch to renewable since batteries don’t need to have long dangerous power lines, each village can have its own battery station. Also if other companies besides Tesla invest in making better batteries this will enforce our current economic system and it help spread.

Before The Flood: The film was brilliant for a variety of reasons. First, in the way that it approached having Leonardo DiCaprio as the face and protagonist. The film let the viewer who follows Leo through his learning process see that he is an activist who wants to learn and create change as much as humanly possible. The film shows the back lash that is seen by various news station hosts as it is announced that Leo has become an ambassador for the UN. By showing this backlash and showing Leo stating that he is not immensely informed on the topic it makes the film more relatable for people, such as myself, who are interested in learning about the effects of climate change on our planet. The visuals that the film portrays as Leo travels the globe obtaining information were strikingly dismal. One particular scene that stood out in my viewing was the house that had once been buried meters under solid ice, but had since melted in a span of only twelve years. Twelve years is an astonishingly short amount of time in relation to the geological time-scale and for ice to have melted so quickly quite frankly blew my mind. Another reason I found the film brilliant was its direct calling out to the people who are trying to sabotage the advancement to a more sustainable and neutral climate for out planet. The way the film makers chose to present the owners of fossil fuel companies allows viewers to not only visualize, but see the impact of these peoples selfishness. If the owners of the fossil fuel companies would use their power and money to advance renewable energy the global warming crisis could perhaps be well on its way to seeing improvement. Lastly, I found the segment about a Carbon Tax very interesting. The implementation of such a task seems like it would only benefit society, in the way that it was presented in the film, and I would like to see how the utilization of such a tasks would play out if implemented in the present day U.S.

Before the flood:  <br><br>

Starting with the 'The Garden of Earthly Delights', which contains three parts of pictures with different themes——the beauty of origin life, the “Deadly Sins” and overpopulation, and the burnt landscape——the film successfully catches my attention and implicitly brings its main idea to the audience. 
   <br><br>

One of the main idea of this film is about the climate change caused by human activities, some negative consequence, and many people who deny the existence of global warming due to their self-profits. It is quite a dilemma that we have to exploit more lands to get enough coal, oil, and natural gas to support our daily life in the short run. However, the results coming after these actions: forests are cut down and rivers are poisoned, drive us away from the sustainable way of life in the long term. Almost everything we done in daily life causes the release of CO2, which makes seas rise, ice melt, flood, and drought. What’s more serious, it is hard to believe that roughly half of the members in Congress do not believe in global warming. Many of them violate their vows, abandon their duties, and betray the people, just to keep their wealth. 
   <br><br>

Following the trip of Leonardo DiCaprio to many “victim countries”, we get the chance to see more persuasive evidence in other regions. What impressed me the most was the journey to Beijing, China. Many years ago, people in China usually liked to call Beijing as the Chinese version as “London during the industrial revolution”. It was really like a kind of suffer to walk in the streets in Beijing during that period. People wore masks everywhere and the automobiles kept the foglight on, just in case the pedestrians could not get the sight of the cars (people even could not see the objects within 10 meters through the smog). However, through the willings of the public, the government finally made the right decisions to shut down the polluting enterprises. All I knew at the time was that we were back in a good living environment, but when I look back now, it's more about the long-term goals and a big step forward on global warming issues. 
   <br><br>

The information that scientists and businesses working on new energy sources and the Climate Change in Paris has given me new hope for the situation. Although it may not be enough, people all over the world are now trying to save the world and they are in the right direction. The global warming is a serious issue. The disasters that have already happened. It is time that we should do something before it is too late, just Before the Flood.
  <br><br>



An Inconvenient Sequel:  <br><br>

In 2006, formal Vice President Al Gore gave important messages about climate change in An Inconvenient Truth and won an Oscar Prize. However, many plotters, especially some businessmen and politicians, are still trying to make people doubt the truth of global warming. I am outraged by their behavior of abandoning the future of all humanity for their selfish desires. In An Inconvenient Sequel, Al Gore tried to convince more people and reveal the reality of the situation.
   <br><br>

Begin with the travel in Greenland in April, the filmmaker recorded the scene of the explosion of glacier due to high temperature, which leads to 12 meters glacier loss and serious floods in many cities. For example, in Miami, Florida people have to raise the road even when the pumps are working in full power. More severe consequences are presented in the film––the spread of Zika and the stronger ocean-based storms. In this film, hopes appear: 100% of Scotland’s electricity comes from wind power since August 7, 2016; Portugal operated 4-day straight on renewable energy alone in May,2016. Introducing the dangers of global warming is not the main content of this movie, and what impresses me is the Indian response during the meeting in Paris. Indeed, many developed countries do have the option of slowing development, devoting some of their attention to environmental governance, and it seems reasonable to ask other countries in the world to act together. From the standpoint of India, even the problem of people's food and clothing has not been solved very well. It is not a wise decision to spend a lot of money to invest in renewable energy. If I were an administrator of India, I would keep using conventional resources for the sake of my people and show suspect to the suggestions from those developed countries. The real ideas of politicians are hard to figure out. In the face of global problems, even under the banner of working for the benefit of all humankind, no one can guarantee that everything done at this time will not contain a little lust or conspiracy. However, the final result makes feel hopeful. The United States helped India build many solar panels, and India finally agreed to sign on the Paris Treaty. Although more and more obstacles keep coming up, I believe that we will get huge success in making the Earth a better place to live. “After the last NO comes a YES. And on that YES the future world depends.”––Wallace Stevens

Before the Flood - I found this documentary quite informative and engaging to watch, as it takes the viewer on a journey throughout the world, visiting the spots that are of great concern with regards to climate change. Seeing pictures and videos of the devastating effects of climate change made the film more real, and thus more daunting and scary to the audience. I think that sometimes it can be difficult to see the effects of global warming because they can appear to be so subtle and minimal; though, when looked at on a global scale and while journeying to the various areas in the world where the effects are greatest, climate change is so apparent. From the flooded streets in Miami to the melted icy landscapes in Greenland, it's hard to believe that so many of our Congressmen continue to deny climate change. It's frustrating to see people accumulate great amounts of wealth at the expense of the environment. 

   <br><br>

I remember years ago seeing Leonardo DiCaprio winning an Oscar, and during his speech making a powerful statement about climate change. Seeing celebrities make statements on current issues like climate change is not strange by any means. What is strange, however, is actually seeing these public figures at work and actively making change. I had no idea the extent DiCaprio was involved in this issue and was very impressed at the things he has been able to achieve, like being the ambassador for climate change in the UN. 

   <br><br>

I was intrigued at the part where the lady from India showed DiCaprio and the audience how much energy Americans consume compared to other countries in the world. I'm sure that Americans have no idea how much they are contributing to the global crisis. The United States should be leading the world in the fight against global warming and set the precedent for other countries; instead, we are doing just the opposite and burning astronomical amounts of CO2 and other greenhouse gases into the air. 
   <br><br>


At large, this documentary made me think about my lifestyle and the changes I need to be making. For one, I need to reduce my consumption of beef and other animal products, as they are huge contributors to the global problem. It seems unlikely that many Americans will change their comfortable lifestyles for the well-being of the planet, that nice guy at the end from NASA made me feel good about the idea that people can and will change. Though, the change needs to start now.

An inconvenient sequel depicts Al Gore’s journey in spreading climate change awareness in hopes of motivating people to step up into action. Since the release of the inconvenient truth in 2006, Al Gore’s message has gained significant support. I respect how Al Gore discusses that he is trying to get away from the title of politician. Al Gore understands that climate change is so much more than a political issue. It is an issue regarding humanity and the future of our generations and so needs to deviate away from being just regarded as an idea that mainly people on the left support. Al Gore cares deeply about the issue, which is evident in how he travels for extended periods both learning and giving lectures on the subject. He was even willing to do everything he had available to help India get enough resources/ funding so that they could focus on renewable energy. After watching an inconvenient sequel, I was left feeling comforted seeing how much energy Al Gore is putting into the cause. Even though President Trump has dropped us out of the Paris Agreement, I remain optimistic of the future and current leaders who will rise up to the call.

As many would argue "Before the Flood" is a compelling documentary about the serious issues of climate change. Ran and discussed from the famous actor, Leonardo Di Caprio, he extenuates facts about the topic of climate change and emphasizes on how serious it really is. As he continues to discuss the topic I believe many people don't follow up on the topic only because he is known for his sleazy role in both the great Gatsby or even wolf of Wall Street, along with many others, and bypass the topic only to think its not significant since it's coming from him. Only to find out it is. He may not have a scientific background but anyone in their right mind can explain the concrete details on climate change and because of his high status as can individual he did exactly that. As stated in the video obtaining fossil fuels are the main source of carbon dioxide emissions. There is no "clean" way of obtaining fossil fuels and that is just one of the many problems our Earth is facing. There are many signs that  the Earth is giving us that we do not take into consideration only because it isn't affecting us personally. However Including Bangladesh, India, Africa, most underdeveloped countries, even Florida are all suffering from what is Climate change today. It is said that by 2050, Florida will be underwater; lives will be lost, homes will be ruined, the livelihood of many will be destroyed because of climate change. Which brings me to the fact that the government will not do a single thing about it. "The ocean is not democratic or republican, all it knows how to do is rise", this quote directly from the documentary is a great example that what we do to the environment is not in any political parties ideological control but what are actions do. Bills have been tried to be passes however the main obstacle is the people in congress. Most if not all are all skeptics and non-believers of climate change which does not let the bills get passed through the final stage. These skeptics need to realize they are the bridge to an actual future to the planet and their actions can be the reason to the loss of many. urbanization and deveolpment is on the rise and although is good for the people, not necessarily good for the environment. There are ways to decrease our carbon footprint but everyone has to be on board. It has to start with the greatest sources of emission which in fact is the United States, once they cooperate others will as well.

Having watched both of the films, it is not difficult to accept that they are both influential in motivating people to expand their climate consciousness.  The primary reason I feel that they are successful at this is because of the people starring in them. Leonardo DiCaprio and Al Gore are far more successful at maintaining the audience's attention than if two underground filmmakers were to have narrated the films. Although they are both very interesting films and strong at keeping an audience, I feel they are both weak in showing the facts and numbers behind climate change compared to other environmental related documentaries. The images of climate change affected land and how disastrous it appears now are what saves these documentaries. In "An Inconvenient Sequel" I grew more anxious than before after seeing the catastrophic floods happening all around the world and how foreign governments are taking these clear signs of environmental danger seriously. And then there's Miami, where the governor of Florida "doesn't see a problem" as stated by Gore and no action has been taken. I don't believe the switch to renewable energy is a complicated task, but as long as the oil industry convinces the public it is unnecessary it will forever remain as so. 
   <br><br>


Although I am fully supportive of Al Gore's mission, I was opened to a new perspective on fossil fuel consumption during Gore's visit to India. Why, after so many years of excessive fossil fuel consumption that enabled its development and modernization, should America be allowed to tell underdeveloped countries to refrain from fossil fuel consumption that would help their development? I feel that American politicians are ignorant towards that fact that this country is the root of climate change for reasons more than direct fossil fuel consumption. I believe if American politicians accepted and welcomed the climate change prevention practices that foreign countries such as those in Europe possess, the unpredictable climate would become slightly more predictably. But first, citizens with no knowledge or those who do not believe in climate change need to accept that it is happening.

In “Before the Flood,” Leonardo DiCaprio begins the film by explaining his inspiration and amazement with the natural world, setting the tone for the entirety of his story and providing backing for his environmental activism. Although DiCaprio doesn’t have a scientific background, he still cares deeply about the state of the environment and can use his fame to take a public stance on preserving the natural world. DiCaprio recognizes his lack of expertise in the subject, thereby humbling himself to the viewers, which I appreciate. Through this, I believe more people are willing to listen to what he has to say, rather than completely disregarding his passion to educate himself and others about this pressing issue.
   <br><br>

As mentioned near the beginning of the film, many activists were focused on individual changes to help the planet. While these small-scale changes are still very important, people pushing for them often forget to acknowledge the large part of this world’s population that lives in poverty and has little flexibility in their ways of living. For populations of low-income and poverty, survival is their main focus, and as theorized in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, changing their lives to accommodate the environment cannot be their top priority. Because of this, climate change is not only an environmental issue, but one of social justice.
   <br><br>

Some of the most frustrating and disturbing parts of this documentary were the lack of belief in climate change and the strong opposition to its existence held by politicians in our country. This climate denialism is extremely dangerous. Not only will our planet suffer, but the more people follow these deniers’ claims, the more challenging it will be to spark any form of movement in helping the climate. Politicians calling climate change a “hoax” is both unacceptable and hypocritical; given that these “climate change deniers” have little to no background in scientific research, it would be wrong to criticize climatologists in their findings. However, politicians claim that not only is the scientific evidence of anthropogenic climate change unbelievable and untrustworthy, but that their uneducated stance on climate change is correct. Partisan divide has proven to be a huge roadblock in development and motivation for solving our climate crisis, and until environmental decisions can be based on fact rather than opinion, essential environmentally-conscious changes to our way of living cannot be made.

I completely agree with your stance that DiCaprio was a great fit for this role. As an admitted non-professional, viewers can relate to him due to their shared desire to become more educated about climate change. He acts as a bridge between the experts and the audience, answering questions on behalf of us. Although DiCaprio definitely knows more than the average person, the primary research he does through his travels paints a vivid picture of the reality and severity of climate change.

It’s interesting to see the difference between the lifestyles of those in first world countries, such as the US, and those in third world countries, such as India. In India, there are 300 million people without energy, and 30% without electricity. On the other hand, Americans use more energy than any other population. From our first-world perspective, we encourage people to not support fast fashion, switch to renewable energy sources, use less water, explore less polluting forms of transportation––all beneficial, small scale ways to support the environment. However, like you pointed out, this isn’t an option for those in India. It’s up to those of us with the privilege of having energy and wealth, according to Sunita Narain, to act as an example for those in third world countries. We must be the ones resorting to wind and solar energy despite our access to cheap energy. This is the way that the rest of the world will begin to not only have energy, but energy that is renewable. 

   <br><br>

The position that politicians of this country take against climate change is worrying to me as well. Though in my opinion, their denial of the problem is not the worst part. Yes, it’s horrible that politicians such as James Inhofe claim that global warming is a hoax simply due to the presence of snow. But the reason why these people in power maintain their opinions is the money they receive from big oil companies. Our government is corrupt, due in part to the profit available from coal and oil. These companies keep the politicians who deny climate change in office and because of this, our environment is suffering. We must work on ways to improve our government, viewing it as a political issue and a climate issue.

In "Before the flood", I followed Leonardo DiCaprio throughout the world to view and in some cases discover the effects of climate change.  I think the part that struck me the most was that the people who suffer the most, at least early on are the ones who have contributed the least to the CO2 and Methane levels.  In addition to being unjust, this served as a wake up call to me that everything I do can affect others across the world.  Every time I get in my car and drive to the store rather than biking, I am slightly worsening a situation half a world away.  When I multiply this by the hundreds of millions of people worldwide who do the same, it is no wonder the issue shows no sign of improvement.
   <br><br>


Though I have enjoyed many DiCaprio movies, I never really appreciated him for anything other than those roles.  After watching this, I think he is a clear example of how to use stardom to affect public opinion for the better.  I respect that he seems to be actually invested in the issue and wants to travel around to see the various consequences.  I also appreciate that he acknowledged how he likely has one of the larger footprints, but was doing what he could to mitigate it.  Though the voluntary carbon tax does nothing to mitigate the actual carbon footprint of making the film, it was a nice gesture and showed acknowledgement of the cost/price travel causes to the planet.
   <br><br>


  Perhaps the most interesting thing I heard in the movie was how much of a role model America and China are to the rest of the world.  Though it is obvious that both countries have a large economic and military presence, it was curious to see how even taking a stance against climate change could cause a bunch of other countries to start working together.  President Obama's interview in particular was quite interesting, as he was talking about how the Paris Accord was a good start, but that the U.S. and China needed to exceed those goals, which DiCaprio reiterates at the very end.  Overall, this documentary was entertaining throughout and informed me about some of the most important consequences of climate change  that are happening as we speak.

Before the Flood: I had never heard about this documentary prior to being assigned to watch it for this class but I have been aware of Leonardo Dicaprio's environmentalist and climate change awareness efforts from the news and by following his Instagram page, where he is very vocal about such issues in terms of spreading this information to his large following. It has always impressed me about the fact that as a renowned actor Leonardo has been using his large platform to educate his fans and the public but sometimes I wondered whether he actually was trying to involve himself in efforts to fix the problem or just being a passive messenger about global warming like some celebrities seem to do solely for praise/sympathy. However, after watching Before the Flood and witnessing Dicaprio as he travelled to diverse areas across the world that were enduring some of the worst effects of climate change + actively getting input from people living there rather than only interjecting his own opinion I gained a newfound respect for him as a person and grateful that influential people like him were out there trying to make this issue more prominent. I also appreciated how self aware he was about how large his own carbon footprint as a person of his wealth has compared to others and going so far as to pay the carbon tax for this film, something that I don't see a lot of other celebrities talk about considering they use air travel and private jets much more than the common person. 
   <br><br>

It was both enlightening and harrowing to realize that the places who probably contribute the least to climate change in disadvantaged areas such as Indonesia, India, and tropical regions were the ones who were already receiving the deadly effects of it firsthand including flooding and crop devastation. When Leonardo was talking with the president of Kiribati who described that he had bought a whole island to migrate his people due to the threat of the island being submerged underwater in the coming years, I was in shock. Climate change has always been such an abstract thought for me and naively I had been thinking that the effects were only subtle in modern times, but I was not anticipating that sea levels had risen to such a high degree that islands and coastal cities such as Miami and Long Beach were at risk of being permanently flooded. The fact that myself and others at this school go to a school so close to the ocean is also not a comforting thought, because at the rate that climate change has been occurring and with sea levels rising it is very possible that even UCSB itself may cease to exist in the future in the same way. Another thing that really put this issue into perspective was when Dicaprio travelled to Greenland and it was revealed that nearly 30 meters of ice had melted in such a short period of time, as well as seeing such rapid water flow in an area that I had always believed to be completely frozen over. It's sad to see how negligence and a lack of action has led such things to occur, and these problems will only exacerbate with time if nothing is done.
   <br><br>

One thing that really stuck out to me however was how realistic the woman from India that Dicaprio interviewed was about the whole ordeal of preventing climate change. People rely on the burning of fossil fuels and dangerous practices that contribute to an increase of greenhouse gas emissions because whether we like it or not, these things are what are necessary for us as a society to function in the current world that we live in. Poor countries such as India and others cannot afford to make the changes towards clean energy and also have no precedent for doing so as long as the major powers behind climate change such as the US sets an example for the rest of the world to follow. Although this is what I and many others can only hope for, I think the reality is that the greed of major corporations who fund anti-climate change propoganda and have the means to pay off scientists to denounce awareness efforts will ultimately prevail, unless the vast majority of Americans can rise up to see the truth about what is going on and forcefully demand changes. Otherwise, we're really just screwed and helpless to change the inevitable.

I agree with your opinion that poorer countries should not be expected to use renewable energies, since larger, more developed countries have been benefitting from coal, oil and natural gas for over a hundred years. I would like to point out that benevolent entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are donating millions of dollars and creating "Gigafactories" to help power poorer countries like India without going to non-renewable sources of power. I think people like Elon Musk will be key in stopping the ridiculous amount of carbon emissions which are currently destroying our planet.
   <br><br>


I think the film also did a good job of uncovering the corruption in the US government and how oil companies are bribing politicians to pass policies that not only help these companies save money, but give them money directly through subsidies. No other country suffers from these same kinds of politically powerful companies, which is why you see more power used per American than anywhere else in the world. I think this has also become a cultural issue, as old farts who don't care what happens to future generations take what money they can get. This creates a sense of young vs old, which is tragic considering I've always been taught to respect my elders. It's also sad to see the climate crisis become a political issue as all climate deniers in the House and Senate are republicans. However, republicans such as Mankiw show us that one's opinion on climate change has less to do with one's political standing.

In the film “Before the Flood” I believe that Leonardo DiCaprio and his crew did an amazing job in addressing the problem of climate change and what is currently going on in our world and what needs to be done to help address climate change. In this film, I think that it was extremely effective in following DiCaprio as he learns throughout the film about climate change and brings the viewer along for the fide. With many specific moments that stuck to my mind throughout the film, the film was not only extremely educational but did a really impressive job in entertaining the reader through teaching them about the climate issue that is currently pressing the world today. Such moments include when DiCaprio said that “it sounded like a nightmare science fiction film” in describing his reaction to when then vice president Al Gore explained to him the consequences of then called global warming, now called climate change.
   <br><br>
The additional depth in talking about why little to nothing is being done to combat climate change also intrigued me as the film talked about the special interest of the fossil fuel industry and why from a legislative perspective action seems to be scarce. I thought that it was an interesting point to make that we need to change the public view on alternatives like carbon tax because although we see our presidents or officials as our elected leaders, they are really our elected followers as they will do what is publicly popular. If we, the common people can enact change and prompt our leaders to take action then I also think that the point about the wasteful agriculture practices of the U.S. in particular should be mentioned. In a resonating statistic, a scientist who studies agriculture and its relationship to climate change stated how beef is the most inefficient form of agriculture and releases most of the methane into our atmosphere and even if one person switches from eating beef to chicken, they would reducing the amount of greenhouse emissions they contribute to by about 80% depending on where someone lives. This gives me hope that myself and others can individually make choices that will influence and protect the climate without having to sit on our hands and wait for elected leaders to create sweeping legislation, which often seems like an unlikely possibility.

I agree in the fact that this film was made very relatable, because although DiCaprio is more of an expert in the field than I am, he took on the role of the student. While watching we weren't made to feel inferior but rather empowered. At the beginning of the film I had no idea DiCaprio had even made this documentary, and I was very impressed by his delivery of concepts as well as responses to all that was going on. I thought the credibility of the subject and film was established well by bringing in very influential people such as Obama, Elon Musk, the Pope, the Indian woman, and all the other people he talked to. They all brought in a different perspective of the topic and their idea to a solution that is achievable if acted upon. I feel like by reaching out to many different sources as well as going to many different places truly helped show how there are detrimental affects of the climate crisis all over the world that are already in action. I was shocked that not more has been done to currently elevate some of the environmental stress of the situation and thought it was very informative to learn how deeply politics were involved in the continuation of harmful environmental industries such as the fossil fuel industry. I agree with your statement about the ironic idea that if we fight for the change our political leaders will follow. I also found it interesting how much beef has an impact on the environment, as well as palm oil. I was actually eating Nutella and ritz crackers while watching this and immediately felt like throwing up. Honestly a lot of the film brought up these emotions of fear, and stress and wanting to cry. Like DiCaprio said, the more I found out just from this film, the more I feel like I don't know.
   <br><br>
This documentary really inspired me to raise my environmental awareness and takes small steps that can largely impact the environment. I feel like by watching DiCaprio set an example and practicing what he preaches through being vegan and putting a carbon tax on his own film, I want to not only believe in the cause but also take steps to personally improve the situation. Most of all I realized, I may not Know everything right now, but I WANT to know, and I want to act. There will be no more Nutella in my fridge from now on, you can count on that!
<br><hr>
Great point about bringing in other influential people into the story while still maintaining the novice perspective of DiCaprio. These different insights were some of the most important and stuck with me throughout the movie. These unique different perspectives as u said such as Obama, Elon Musk, the Pope and the climate scientist from Indian all added unique perspectives while still linking them through the narrative of DiCaprio and his quest for learning more about climate change. In reading your comment and reflecting on the film I can see that this method of bringing in different viewpoints in a structured way around DiCaprio was one of the most effective methods the film used in trying to portray the issue of climate change in an academic and informative way while still presenting it in a way that appealed to someone who may not know much about the issue.

In the film, "Before the Flood" It showed the drastic action that people went to discrediting climate change. In fact, I was shocked when i found out how many people, credible people, didn't believe in climate change and were actively going out of their way to discredit it. Leonardo DiCaprio faced many attacks from people when during his crusade for climate change. People insulting him for having no scientific background to support such a cause was a strong argument on him not knowing what he was talking about. I believe that Leonardo DiCaprio is a great ambassador for such a huge modern issue. The common person isn't very integrated into science and having an actor who is very integrated into modern culture would be a strong connection to this climate issue However in the documentary, it was evident that the absolute insane amount of damage that was happening to the forests. Into the scene where huge parts of the forest was destroyed and removed for the oil underneath really resonated with me. As Leo said, it looked like Mordor where it was a huge black wasteland. We never see such giant overviews of deforestation and that was the first time i saw the actual scope of the issue.

   <br><br>


The palm oil that was in every single product really shocked me. Many people try their best to avoid items are have a bad reputation or evil producing methods, however I had no idea that palm oil is incredibly bad for the environment and impossible to get away from it. other things like beef are terrible for the environment. Not only does it produce huge amounts of Methane, It produced a huge caloric deficit as the plants that the animals consume have much more calories then the meat that is produced. We could feed way more people with the plants then the meat. This documentary was a huge wake up call and did a great job at putting the whole problem in a single frame.

I have enjoyed this film and learned many things about climate crisis through this video. The title: Before the Flood, just as “the calm before the storm”, it serves as an alarm and gave us a sense of emergency that makes us to believe it is the last moment to do anything about the upcoming crisis before it is too late. 
   <br><br>
At the beginning of the film, it begins with a painting. It is about the prediction made by an artist. He believes that the future of human kind will eventually destroyed by humans themselves. Such believes are commonly shared by those people who are believe in the environmental problem, which leads the audiences to get a closer look at those problems with the protagonist.
   <br><br>
The whole content is about how the protagonist got more understanding of the crisis. In the film, he asked many people about their perspectives, and he also went to few places himself to experience the impact of industrialization on the environment of earth. Through this process, audiences can be brought to a scenario as they were study those problems themselves. 
   <br><br>
Through using the famous actor Leonardo DiCaprio as the narrator, this film can exert a huge impact within the society. Leonardo DiCaprio is viewed as a public icon for environmental protection and his fame can bring many people to get to know about this issue and persuade them to do something about it.

<p>
“Before the Flood” absolutely served as a wake-up call to me, and I think that seeing the impact of climate change through pictures, videos, and personal experiences made the issue seem much more real and daunting to the rest of the audience as well. While watching the documentary, I found myself feeling shocked over and over by the state in which people on the other side of the planet are living, but realizing how many ignorant politicians sit in our government is what frustrated me the most. 
   <br><br>


I cannot wrap my head around the fact that such a significant portion of congressmen deny human impact on climate change, and that in Florida politicians have gone to the extent of banning the words “climate change” in government. It surprised me that people such as Michael Mann who dedicate so much time and effort into researching the effects of global warming and strive for change receive death threats and are attacked by strangers simply because they want to share what they have discovered. It further angered me when I learned that people “sell” their credentials to fossil fuel companies just for wealth, rather than considering the real impact of their actions. I also learned that many fossil fuel companies pay congressmen to deny climate change to selfishly maintain their wealth, which prevents any climate change bills from being passed. 
   <br><br>


I feel that presenting Leonardo DiCaprio as the protagonist of this documentary was a clever way to draw much more attention to the issue of global warming because he is such a well-known actor working to fight such a crucial issue. Although he may be playing an onscreen persona that is not as informed as he truly is, I think it is an effective rhetorical device in that it allows audience members to better connect with him in his journey of learning more about climate change. After all, audience members are most likely those who are eager to learn the truth about climate change but are not experts themselves.

I agree with you on multiple aspects. The Documentary served somewhat as a wakeup call for me. However, I feel even more than it just being a wakeup call to me, it was a wakeup call that I need to go out and educate others on this issue. The film really made me feel as if knowledge is power. As you touched upon, we are living in a diverse world, with many different lifestyles (Some so much worse than the ones we live here in America.) Through the actions of the more developed countries, developing countries are feeling more of the impact. This is all taking place while our ignorant politicians are sitting in seats of power denying the issue in order to preserve their career. 
    <br><br>

It makes me feel a bit better that you pointed out how frustrating it was to see the congress men in positions of power denying climate change because that made me livid. The Ban on words “climate change” in Florida is mortifying. With the knowledge of how the people “representing” the US citizens are acting just for power makes me almost angry at the government from having a system in place that allows such corruption to occur. Watching all of these aspects unfold and come to play made me realize how important it is to get the true message out to the world. To educate all people young and old. To teach them about the power of voting, the benefits of CO2 taxes and all the things that they can do ot reduce their impact and support what they believe. 
    <br><br>

I agree with you that choosing Leonardo DiCaprio was a strategic choice. Not only is it bringing a familiar face to a topic that can be hard to sit and listen to, but he is also in support of taking action now. People who look up to DiCaprio may watch the film and learn about the tragedies taking place on the earth. While I think that Leonardo DiCaprio was a good spokesperson I also understand where the criticism was coming from. He is not an educated scientist; he is an actor. For the educated citizens they might discredit him due to his “lack” of education in the field. This may have caused a loss of some of the audience.
<br><hr>
I wholeheartedly agree with you. Corporate interests have rendered the government completely ineffective in regards to climate change (among other things) and I believe it is up to this nw generation to call attention to this issue and do what we can to stop it. I fear by then it might be too late but for the moment, but we might as well do all that we can now in the hopes that the boomers hand us a salvageable planet.

Before the Flood: I would like to start by saying this documentary really opened my eyes on how severe the issue of climate change really is. It really put into perspective the damage that people have done to the Earth. I think Leonardo DiCaprio does a phenomenal job with this documentary. He really put himself out there as many people criticized him for being a believer of climate change and an advocate for science. Leo faced the scrutiny of the public and the members of our own government who deny that climate change is real. People question his credentials because they see him as "just an actor". In this documentary he was on a mission to show people how severe the damage is. The pollution today stems from consumerism. The energy industry is a large contributor to the pollution we have today. From their methods of extracting and producing their goods to the actual use of them are all factors when it comes to polluting the earth. The issue that arises is that these large energy companies lobby congress members to not pass any legislation against their cause which is making more money. If the US could pass legislation restricting energy companies it would be a big step towards resolving the issue of climate change. There are alternative energy sources out there that are renewable and could potentially save the Earth but many people are still skeptical about climate change as a whole, they don't buy into these solutions. This documentary's purpose was to open people's eyes and show them the world we live in today. If people start to support the movement there still is time to slow down climate change and possibly save us all.

I completely agree with everything you wrote. Leonardo did a fantastic job showing us what is going on in the world and why we should be worried and that climate change does stem from out consumerist culture. I would like to emphasize the role of politics in this entire ideal though. Countries across the developed world have made it a major issue to promote climate change and do something about it. The film portrayed Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden for examples. The problem is they do not out put as much carbon dioxide as the US, yet there are leaders that refuse to make a change. It baffles me how some of our leaders can blatantly ignore the mountain of scientific evidence that just keeps getting larger and larger. It is almost an insult to the scientists themselves, as they are doing potentially planet saving work, yet getting ignored at every possible turn by our leaders. This part upsets me the most. 
    <br><br>
One thing I can take in  consideration is the scientists, when interviewed, seem to be the most optimistic ones. They are the ones who are trying to solve this problem and if they can be optimistic, then I can too.

The movie Before the Flood centers around Leonardo DiCaprio’s journey to uncover the truth about climate change and become more informed on the ways in which it takes an affect globally. I feel that it is an interesting tactic using DiCaprio as this ambassador for climate justice as he, in a way, represents this “elite” class of people, those who have the most money in the world that could almost instill the most change, second to politicians. This may sound like a reach, however, celebrities not only have exponentially more money than they will ever need, and more influence over the public than most people, and their use of their money and “power” can help many others by donating to organizations or influence their audience to make certain changes as they do. I feel as if using DiCaprio not only makes people interested to watch the film as he is loved by many, in turn educating thousands of people but also influence other celebrities to take their stance and use their platforms to instill actual change in the world, rather than promoting brands or labels.

    <br><br>

I feel as if this “exposé” style was beneficial in explaining the dimensions of climate change. The focus on inequality and corruption allows the audience to see what is actually occurring in our world. The political aspect of climate change always annoyed me growing up, as I find it amazing that politicians try to take science and make it a partisan issue. I found it important that they include the segment about corruption because I feel as if the relationship between corporations and politicians to be very dangerous, and shows how the interests of these powerful people remain between themselves, and not to benefit the greater good of society. Along with this, I admired DiCaprio in the scenes in which he travelled to other countries. I feel as if he remained open to understanding the severity of these issues and humble trying to understand how climate change has affected their communities, allowing them to be heard. In speaking to Dr Sunita Narain, he sympathizes with her as she explains how she finds it frustrating when American NGOs tell impoverished countries to change their ways while first world nations continue business as usual. Though he agrees, she says: “I’m sorry to say this, and I know you’re American, so please don’t take this the wrong way, but your consumption is really going to put a hole in the planet. I think that’s the conversation we need to have.” She continues to explain how investment in solar is growing, yes, but not in the places that are detrimental to the world, such as the U.S.. His reactions are important, as I feel many times when corrected people are on the defense, but he understands his place and how his lifestyle is not benefitting anyone but himself. On an issue like this it is important that we allow those who are truly suffering, who see the other end of this problem to speak and be heard and I feel as this documentary does just that.

    <br><br>

Though DiCaprio is an activist, he may be vegan and all that, but he is still an American. He comes from a first world country, his job forces him to travel by plane and he probably eats exotic foods and has invested in products that come to existence at the exploitation of someone else. These are things we as Americans all relate to, this movie is not made for those struggling to maintain heat to cook their food by burning uplas, it is for those in power, with privilege, and those who can easily turn a blind eye as these problems are actively hidden away from us...for now.

What stuck out to me most about Before the Flood was how Leonardo DiCaprio went about presenting the climate crisis on both a global and very local scale at the same time.  Over the course of the movie he was not as much a source of information, rather guiding the plot through his questioning of the experts that he interviewed.  Taking him to many different parts of the world, all affected by climate change in a unique and devastating way, the movie did an excellent job of presenting the harm our global pollution has done to very local areas.  What stuck out to me the most from the film was when he visited India and talked with both the climate change expert and local farmer.  By interviewing and getting to know the stories of both local people harmed by our excessive pollution, and the ones in their country trying to fix the problem, it creates a clearly different picture than how we in more developed nations view climate change.  It was a perspective that is not talked about as often as it should be, how first world nations may preach sustainability without realizing that the poorest people of our world have seemingly no climate safe options to live by.  Coal is simply the best, or only, energy option for many Indian people, and to deny their use of it on the basis of the climate crisis creates a humanitarian issue in of itself.  Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job of presenting this discrepancy between how to very different societies view the same global issue.  When interviewing the Indian climate change expert he essentially presented himself as he would want the rest of developed nations citizens to as well.  He was initially uninformed of just how differently India was being affected by the climate crisis, and let the expert speak her view on the injustices done to her country by first world polluters.  She was rightfully harsh when speaking about the excessive consumption American culture idolizes, and let DiCaprio know just how damaging it is to her country.  Watching the scene it felt like each of them, DiCaprio and the expert, were representing their countries by themselves.  By the end of the conversation it was agreed upon by both that the U.S. is not even close to setting a good example for the rest of the world when it comes to solving the problem of climate change.  While we may tell developing countries to not make the mistakes we did, and instead invest in renewable energy, we ourselves do not follow the advice and continue to rely on gas and coal for our energy.  DiCaprio wants himself to be an example of how Americans should change their over consumption mindset, and start being the change that they preach others to make.

In the film, "An Inconvenient Sequel" which focuses on Al Gore's continued fight to demonstrate his credibility when discussing climate change as well as educating the public on the issue of climate change. I agree that the sequel was much better than the first documentary, mainly because this film contained more recent events with current problems we're facing. But one fault within this film was that Gore spent too much time rebutting the claims that he wasn't credible enough to be lecturing on climate change. He did however, disprove those remarks because he was one of the spokesmen for the Paris Climate Accord and he continues to educate the public about the future we will be living in if action isn't taken. One thing I admire about Al Gore is that he has dedicated his life to the fight for climate change and refuses to back down when presented with critique. With all that said  Gore shed light on to an extremely important question regarding India, why should they be stunted from growth because countries like the U.S abused fossil fuels for their own gain?
       <br><br>
India was justified in wanting to build 400 coal powered plants even though it wasn't environmentally friendly. However, Gore's plan to to help them install solar panels so they could move away from fossil fuels was the key India to sign the Paris Climate Agreement. India raised great points about how the U.S can be considered a hypocrite because our country was raised on cheap fossil fuels like carbon and oil but now we want developing countries to completely skip over that step. But now that India is on the renewable path they will likely see steady growth for years.

Before the Flood- I had never even heard of this video before and now, I can't stop talking and recommending it to my friends and family. This is such an amazing eye-opening film that I feel should be talked about more. Watching this film I was absolutely speechless, and I never realized how naive and uneducated I was about the climate crisis. In this particular case we see a celebrity being the one to take action on this crisis, something more public figures should be doing. If more people with power big enough to make a difference do at least half of what Leonardo did, maybe people would be ready to start talking about this crisis and changes we can start making right now to resolve it. Instead of calling it a "hoax". DiCaprio's journey begins when he is announced the messenger of peace in the United Nations. Right off the bat we see him being criticized because of his life style, and you can tell by his reaction that DiCaprio was expecting this backlash from the public. Yes I understand the whole "well what does he know about global warming? He's just an actor", and yes he is an actor, but he's an actor that is trying to make a change in this world. He has brought more awareness to this crisis than most of the reporters out there. And shouldn't that be their job? Report world wide problems, because this isn't just a country issue, this is a whole other matter that affects every single person on this planet. 
       <br><br>

Watching the comments the reporters made on DiCaprio and global warming just left me stunned. These are people on national television and just hearing the worlds that come out of their mouths left me shocked. Specifically this one reporter that said something along the lines of " if you believe in global warming, then you are one dumb sun of a bitch". Honestly, really? There are scientist out there that dedicate their whole lives to that! That's their job to say whether if global warming exist or not, and if they say it does, shouldn't we listen?! If I were a scientist dedicating my life to the environment I would've quit by now. It's insulting that they're telling us what the problem is and how we can fix it, and we're just ignoring them. I just can't believe people are doing that, and that fact that before this video I was one of those people. 
       <br><br>

Towards the middle of the film they start taking a political view at the crisis. At this point I wanted to jump in the screen and punch everyone. I never thought about the whole corruption part. I was thinking that maybe people just didn't want to see the truth and they were choosing to be ignorant. It's sad how our politicians, the people who are supposed to look out for the well being of the people, are one of the reasons why we are in this mess right now. The fact that they can't get laws passed to tax carbon, so it reduces the rate at which it's being used by companies just because the big corporations are buying politician's votes is ridiculous. We always judge other countries for their corrupt government, and here we are, calling the kettle black. What repulses me more is the fact that these people come out on tv, saying that they're doing the best for us, which they're not, and being total hypocrites about this whole mess. We see the data, we feel the actual change in temperature, and you're telling us global warming isn't a thing? I think it' very embarrassing to these politicians that we, the public, can learn about how they're being bought off by oil companies. But that's something most people don't want to learn about. They don't want to admit that we are at the point of no return. We have ruined this world and we've only got ourselves to blame.
       <br><br>

This film really made me change my views in a lot of ways, and I really hope my views aren't the only thing that change, but my actions as well. Actions as simple as changing your eating habits. A new diet plan isn't the end of the world, or in this case it is. I can't wait to learn more about this crisis in this course, what is to be our near future.

Before the Flood: I enjoyed this film immensely and believe it was the most effective at communicating the urgency of dealing with climate change. It was very impactful through the varied images as they were fast-paced of different activities that demonstrated humans destroying the Earth. I love how Leanoardo Dicaprio admits that he doesn't know and understand everything about global warming but is still willing to become educated. Many people do not acknowledge his information because he is just some “Hollywood actor;’ however, one must admire that he is willing to become more educated. Many people push off the idea of climate change because they don’t know the details of how negatively it is affecting the environment and are not willing to take the time to learn.  The examples are quick-paced and continuous which keeps the audience entertained. 97% of scientists agree that global warming is a real issue and yet people still argue that it is a hoax: anti-global warming campaigns are funded by fossil fuel corporations who only care about making profits. Chinese media talks about global warming on a regular basis and changed their plan to renewable energy while the U.S. disregards the issue almost completely. I also really like the call to action in the end that makes people feel like change is possible with small steps.

Having watched both Before the Flood and An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, the two different approaches these films take are certainly made to appeal to different audiences. In Before the Flood, DiCaprio acts as an extension of the audience, learning about the effects of climate change along with the audience. DiCaprio does not come from a place of extensive knowledge, but one of intense curiosity and passion for the issue. This approach is clever because this is the mindset the film wants to pass onto its viewers. The film encourages viewers to become curious, see the truth about climate change, and start advocating for change.
        <br><br>
Contrarily, An Inconvenient Sequel follows Al Gore, a well-known climate advocate who has served in government for years attempting to convince U.S. policymakers to create standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Gore has worked on the politics side of the climate change debate for years, and this is made clear by the numerous meetings and conferences he is shown holding in order to educate others on the science and negotiate with countries on their energy policies.
       <br><br>
 Frankly, Before the Flood’s approach is much more successful in the goal of climate change education, as it provides tons of visual evidence of the effects of climate change and is a learning journey along with the narrator. An Inconvenient Sequel acts more as a documentation of Al Gore’s actions, cutting back and forth from his numerous Powerpoint presentations, and showing how his actions fulfill each of his talking points. While it can be argued that it succeeds if its goal is to showcase Gore’s heroism in being a major advocate for climate change by dedicating years of his life to saving our Earth, in terms of climate education for the viewer, Before the Flood is a superior educational and visual experience for someone looking to learn about the crisis facing society.

Having also watched both films, I agree with your analysis. I think that Before the Flood offers a more in-depth explanation of many different aspects of what Climate Change is and the consequences of it, while An Inconvenient Sequel focuses more on just Fossil Fuels and the Paris Climate Conference. I agree with you in the fact that Before the Flood can appeal to a wider variety of viewers as it is very easy to understand and draws upon people’s emotions in an attempt to get people to care. I also think that Al Gore’s film was very informative and gives people an in depth perspective on the political challenges of Climate Change advocacy. I also think that Gore’s position as a retired politician gives him good credibility to speak on these political issues that are occuring. I believe that it is very important for people to understand that they have power as voters and to understand that the people in power will respond if their constituents pressure them into acting in ways that take care of the environment. I think that both films are structured well as the both follow the protagonist, yet the film an Inconvenient Sequel was a little bit unorganized as it kept jumping back and forth between different issues and was slightly harder to follow. I also think that while Gore’s film was educational and inspirational, the main message it was trying to convey was a bit muddled. Yes, it advocated for the adoption of renewable energy and responsibility among politicians and nations, but I think that the film could be majorly improved if it was organized better and had a more complete main argument.

In a recognizable and approachable way, the movie “Before the Flood” raises awareness and seeks to build action towards global warming. By having Leonardo DiCaprio act as a surrogate for the viewer, that was a good way to reach a wider audience and make it more relatable to their own lives. They do this in ways like when DiCaprio admits to not being totally knowledgeable in the subject, just as we might be, proving that you don’t have to study it in order to help improve it. By allowing the viewer to physically see the effect of carbon emissions (melting glaciers, flooding crops, etc), rather than just reading about it in an article, the film motivates us to take action and truly envision the issue. One of the main issues that climate change brings about is that it affects the lower class much more than the higher class. While the rich will be able to move homes or get food even when expensive, the poor won’t have the privilege to take action against climate change. I believe it to be important for everyone to learn about climate change so they can fix it, many may not be willing to put in the work to know more on the subject, so the film “Before the Flood” is a smart way of sharing information with the audience while keeping us engaged. I personally think that the hardest part about fixing climate change as humans will be switching to a plant-based diet, as our culture is so used to beef being ingrained in our diets. Overall, I find the film very interesting and unique because it really forces us to see the effects of climate change and how it will eventually reach all of us. It sends a powerful message to us that we need to take action in whatever ways we can to prevent our approaching demise.

I agree that switching to a plant-based diet will be the hardest part about fixing climate change. I am guilty of being stubborn about not letting go of meat in my diet, possibly because they have always been a part of my life. While I have had friends go vegan, vegetarian, and pescatarian, I have struggled to make a change because I never really thought that me, a single person, could make that much of a difference and I wasn't ready to let go of a food that has been a staple of my life. However, one idea that was proposed in the documentary was that if we could switch from beef to chicken, we could solve a lot of our methane problems. Chickens take up less space and do not produce as much methane as cows. This solution, while far-fetched, is a lot more doable than making a switch to a full-on plant-based diet. On the contrary, a consequence of this solution is that, similar to a carbon tax, money will be an issue. Fully switching to chicken is about as difficult as fully switching to solar because of the money invested into beef and oil. We are too far along this path in order to make a full on change because people are resistant to the idea of big-picture change, so the only thing we can do is change individually and hope that others catch on. If everyone does their part, this can happen.

Before the Flood sheds light on the climate crisis and presents information in a very approachable, easy-to-digest manner. I think the use of a personable figure like Leonardo DiCaprio is an effective method of reaching a wide audience, and making climate activism relevant in pop culture. This film successfully lays out some of the most critical components of climate change and the necessary steps required to combat the crisis. However, I believe that this film is an oversimplification, while also avoiding addressing the root cause of the problem: the capitalist system. While focusing on important mitigation efforts like renewable energy technologies and individual consumer choices (such as meat consumption), the film sidesteps the systemic issue which must be the forefront of the efforts against the climate crisis, and against global social injustice. Before the Flood unfortunately falls in line with many of the non-radical environmentalist frameworks that offer solutions that don't suggest a complete transformation of the world economic model and its associated disparities and inequalities, as well as its engrained exploitative and unsustainable principles. The fact of the matter is that capitalism must continually grow, and the planet simply cannot handle any more human growth.

I think that what makes Before the Floor so effective at communicating its message of the dire nature of climate change is that the viewer learns through an approachable and recognizable figure, Leonardo DiCaprio, about the realities of climate change. The film is not meant to be a journey of the viewer's discovery, but rather the viewer watching the journey of discovery of someone who we can recognize and establish a connection with. This takes away any chance of miscommunication because the information presented is being filtered through DiCaprio as he learns about this complex problem with the viewer--instead of him simply pandering for "change" and "immediate action".

Something I found very interesting from the beginning of the film was how a piece of art (The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch) was able to somewhat predict the future of that the world would be like due to the actions of mankind. From paradise to a world of degradation and burnt landscape, the painting was able to predict how these catastrophes are in our schedule. I think having Leonardo DiCaprio lead this conversation was crucial because he is an influencer in society who has a large following. He is able to reach more people. He wasn’t ignorant to the effects of climate change. In fact he was aware of it, but just wasn’t as informed like the rest of the public. We know about the facts, but there is so much more that contributes to the larger picture that big corporations do not want the public to know. 
       <br><br>
From the fossil fuel industry, it can be seen how catastrophic the process is to our planet. They are destroying landscapes in order to find new sources. From tar sands to offshore drilling, all these things contaminate large bodies of water and use tremendous amounts of energy.
       <br><br>
I think the heart wrenching fact is how big corporations invest into feeding the public lies in order to profit off fossil fuels. They knowingly do this because they know that climate change will affect the poor before it  affects them. 
       <br><br>
It’s crazy to even think about how politicians continue to deny climate change. Due to their denial, climate bills cannot be passed due to the fact that fossil fuel corporations have embedded their way into our politics. 
       <br><br>
It leads to a bigger conversation that more people should be having - how do we reduce our carbon footprint?  
       <br><br>
Being the most influential country and the biggest energy consumer in the world, the U.S. has the power to influence developing nations to change their ways before it’s too late. Something that really captured my attention was when Narain states, “We should put lifestyle and consumption at the center of climate negotiations.” This is crucial to understand because in order to create impactful change, the U.S. must be the first one to take the initiative in changing our ways. We are the ones leaving a bigger carbon footprint than the rest of the world. We cannot expect other countries to change if we fail to do so ourselves.

I also agree that DiCaprio's incorporation of the piece of art is effective in its symbolic effects. The fact that this art piece was made not relating to the issue of climate change but is used to parallel the realities of today is strangely amazing. DiCaprio's use of this exact artwork as his gift to the Pope really sent the entire documentary full circle for me. The symbolism of The Garden of Earthy Delights is striking and really structures the whole documentary to impact the audience on a deeper and more emotional level. 
       <br><br>

I, too, found that DiCaprio's explanation and production of this documentary made it easier for the general public to digest the issue of climate change. I found that throughout the documentary, he would reword or restate the words of these environmental influencers who speak with great facts and statistics in order to reiterate in simpler terms for his audience. 
       <br><br>

The US has a large impact on the globe and many countries need an extra push into joining the movement. Therefore, I agree with you in that the US must start first in order for other countries may feel the motivation to do the same. Once the US begin making drastic and legal changes in the way Americans live their lives to be environmentally friendly, the US media, as well as the greater global media, will spread the news to other countries allowing the momentum of the movement to continue to these places.
<br><hr>
I also found it interesting that the Garden of Heavenly Delights was used to open the film. By using the symbolism of the artwork, the film from the start is set to show us how our future is headed towards if we do not make drastic changes now in order to save the planet. In a way, it reminds me of the Uninhabiatble(or at least unwelcoming) Earth article that we read, as an alarmist approach into scaring its audience into action.

Before the Flood: It is amazed and I am actually really happy about the fact that we have such an amazing celebrity who shows his caring for the world we are living and is helping to raise awareness about the global warming crisis. And I actually really hope that through Leonardo DiCaprio’s power as a public figure, would actually call for more people’s attention on the climate change problem, and I do believe that it is never too late to make a change for the current situation and change for our future, as long as we realize and recognize the climate crisis from now on. There are few parts that caught my attention while I was watching the movie and made me felt sad. First of all, is the fact the there are still some people and most of them are the governors / politicians those who are making money off from the fossil fuel production, who, are even until now, still refused to admit the fact that global warming is not the problem and claim that human-being have no power at all to affect the climate on our earth. While I understand the reality that natural source is the important part in our economy, but when it comes to the point that there is something happening in the planet we are all living and affecting all human lives, how can some people can still be a climate change deniers and not willing to take their responsibility to save the planet we are all living?Are wealth,money and economic growth even more important that saving the world we are living and making it a sustainable one? Also, I like the part when Leonardo was talking with the lady from India and when she pointed out that the people in the undeveloped countries become the victims due the huge pollution made by developed countries such as U.S that causes climate changes, made me feel sad and sorry since we are the people from the wealthy country and our consumption made up the large portion of emission of greenhouse gases but not only we are suffering it ourselves, but making other people in the other parts of the world suffer as well and it is not fair to them and the species living on this planet. 
       <br><br>
It is true that many people don’t recognize the problem of climate change crisis since they have not yet personally experiences the huge and serious enough impacts cause on them. But it does not mean global warming doesn’t exist and which in fact, it is happening right now. The movie is great and let me learn a lot more about the crisis of global warming and alarm me that I should pay more attention concerning the problem as well.

The film “Before the Flood” is extremely thought-provoking and is created in a way that allows the common viewer to easily consume the issue being presented. By utilizing Leonardo DiCaprio as a sort of vehicle that travels around meeting with people like Barack Obama, the Pope, the Secretary of State, and of course climatologists and environmental experts, it allows the audience to feel as if they’re doing this same hunt for information. It’s also helpful that Leo himself admits that he’s no expert. What I think is truly powerful about this documentary is that it follows the story of Leo traveling the world in search of more knowledge about the climate crisis. Rather than being complacent with thinking that he knows enough about the issue, he instead faces his naivety and goes on the conquest to show his answer to the question, “If you could know the truth about the threat of climate change, would you want to know?”.
       <br><br>
Along his journey, he exposed politics as being the biggest barrier to working towards a more sustainable future. This, of course, is a relatively known fact to most individuals. What I found truly shocking is the number of politicians that publicly declare and argue that global warming is a hoax. The worst part is that they are doing it for their own selfish gain to remain allied with major fossil fuel-dependent companies like Shell. Also, the fact that Dr.Mann, the publisher of the “Hockey stick” graph, received attacks from congressman, death threats from many anonymous people, and was vilified by researchers just for simply publishing data that showed a historical occurrence of a prolonged period of cooling followed by an unprecedented spike in temperature, had me beyond disbelief. I found it very interesting that his data provoked such strong reactions from people. It makes me wonder if an attitude of stubbornness or unwillingness to face ignorance is in a way one of the factors causing global warming.

I also agree with you that Leonardo DiCaprio is truly an inspiring, powerful figure in the movement against climate change. Watching him travel the world trying to gain knowledge made me feel like I was part of his journey. It made me feel the need to be an activist for climate change. I also found it shocking how politics are the reason why people do not believe in climate change. It disgusts me how big companies and corporations are using their money to influence the media to change the public's opinion on the climate crisis.

I really think this is a wonderful documentary. It conveys the idea that we are the last hope of earth, and there do have ways we can turn the trend of global warming. DiCaprio went to numerous places all over the world that reflect the tremendous impacts of human activities to the earth and interviewed with politicians and scientists to prove we are working on it and there is way to work the issue out if we put in enough effort. This somehow gives me faith, for i used to think no way we can fully altered the circumstance but only delay the time of catastrophe. After watching this documentary i know we can achieve the ambitious goal if every of us start to do something. We shall urge the government to forward laws on carbon tax alike, we shall eat less beef and switch our diet, and we shall purchase less items that contain palm oils. I know the future can be rather optimistic if every of human being start to do something they can do from now on.

Before the Flood by National Geographic features Leonardo Dicaprio in an eye opening film about the current detrimental reality of climate change. This film further proves DiCaprio is an influence and role model to many in the environmental activist circle. His admirable personal changes as well as the time and energy he puts into the cause is inspiring. When someone of his stature stands up many follow in line. This is exactly what a movement of this severity needs. 
       <br><br>

With the usual lack of compliance from humans to save our planet the need for change is more than ever before. This film educates its audience as well as connecting on a personal and more convincing level with the use of a familiar face. With the current political predicament our country is in and the stance our current president has on climate change our country will not be making legislative changes to save our planet any time soon. Therefore, the need for individual change is dire. The unfortunate reality of our world today is that every person on this planet is more than able but not willing to decrease their carbon footprint. Decreasing an individual's carbon footprint, and eventually the planets, would require small steps from many that would lead to big differences. Lastly, we need to be worried about the less fortunate who will not survive round one of the devastations of climate change. Allowing this to happen is inhumane as well as cruel and unusual punishment. Although the more fortunate will survive longer, no one will be able to escape the effects of climate change in the end.

For the movie featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, the first thing that grabs my attention is the name Before The Flood. The movie starts and ends with painting The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch hanging in DiCaprio’s home, and the name of the movie comes from the second scene of the painting series, Humankind before the flood. In this panel, people are in a transitional period between the best and worst environments. The perfect allusion of our lives nowadays then introduces the whole story leading by DiCaprio. 

       <br><br>

Following the steps of the protagonist, we travel around the world with DiCaprio to discover the whole environmental problem shrouding the human society. In each location or case, Leonardo takes the stands as an audience and asks questions that the general public most cares about. According to his words, “I want to know how much I don’t know, how much we’ve done and what to do.” And there are several points that really leave me a strong impression. 
       <br><br>
The first one is the politics and the conspiracy of huge corporations. In the film, scientists and politicians are like complete opponents to each other. While scientific research shows hard evidence of climate change and global warming, politicians, who are majorly denialism, jump out and openly attack the facts to the public through provocative lobbying. And the reason is merely that most politicians and Congress officials are controlled and funded by fossil fuels companies. Regardless of the collective welfare, those only speak for their own short term interests. Even worse, some transnational corporations in Indonesia intentionally set fire to burn down the natural rainforest just for achieving their goal of growing palm oil. Therefore, standing in front of monetary interests, those who claim to bring maximized well-being to the country choose to ignore the most serious environmental problem. 
       <br><br>


The second one is the question for developing countries. As the developed countries start to take action by adopting new expensive technology, or as wealthy developing countries like China positively transitioning to a renewable way, how the relatively poor areas perform to deal with the problems seem to be difficult. In India, a large population is still under the poverty line and energy such as electricity is unaffordable to the public. Thus, there is no way to treat these countries the same as the lavish US. 
       <br><br>


The last one involves a new way of seeing things in the severity. After being exposed to uncountable cold hard facts supporting why we should protect the environment, the film does not forget the rhetorical effect it can bring. In fact, nearly every figure interviewed has talked about their emotional or private reason for protecting the environment. For example, one reason for the official of Kiribati island to relocate the communities is that he balances the future of his own family and grandchildren. Similarly, as for former President Obama, he does not want his children losing the chance of seeing the ice in Alaska in a romantic way of thinking. Finally, for DiCaprio, through his experience of changing sites to finish the ice scenes in his movie, he deeply concerns the future of the fast-melting ice and whether our offspring will have the opportunity to see snow...All of these personal thoughts are simple, but strongly tug the hearts of the audience by presenting the real emotions of us people. Therefore, the film effectively relates to the public and makes it easier to deliver its argument.

(Before the Flood): Following my viewing of Before the Flood, I read your comment and agree with many of the points that you brought up. The title Before the Flood and the allusion at the beginning of the documentary immediately immersed me into the topic of climate change. I agree with Professor Hiltner that visualizing the climate crisis is also an effective way to convey the climate crisis. The use of the painting The Garden of Earthly Delights by Brosch, as you pointed out, is used at the beginning and end to effectively remind the viewers of the urgent need to take action to prevent the last scene of the painting. Leonardo does a fantastic job of framing himself in the center of this documentary with the realization that many of his fans and followers would be more engaged in the film if he was the main character. Many people in our current generation lack the attention span or engagement to sit and watch a documentary about the climate. By framing the documentary around Leonardo DiCaprio, the producers are able to draw the attention of his fans and the majority of our current generation. DiCaprio’s journey around the globe to learn about all the different aspects of climate change and its effects on the planet is effective because we learn along with him and become more connected to our newly gained knowledge. 
        <br><br>
I was also surprised to learn about the dynamic between scientists and politicians. The fact that fossil fuel companies are paying and bribing politicians to view climate change as a myth is baffling to me because of how blatant the facts of climate change are when you simply look around at the world. The scientists are offering facts and data that clearly show the drastic effects climate change has on the world and it angers me that these politicians are taking bribes and using their power to prevent any immediate action. I was frustrated to hear that those in power who reject the existence of climate change are also the people who receive the most profits from the burning of fossil fuels. Therefore, I share the same frustrations as you when it comes to the priorities of politicians and companies. These groups and individuals are only focused on the monetary value of our environment and do not care to protect or preserve it for future generations. 
       <br><br>
 Last quarter I took HIST74, a class about the history of poverty, and I had already learned about the devastating impacts of climate change in less developed countries. “First World” countries such as the United States feel less of the climate impact when compared to “Third World” countries. Although the film raises this issue, I do not believe that it dives deep enough to how we as individuals can deal with the problems that developed nations face when it comes to climate change. I believe that we need to change our mindset on how we view these “developed countries” and focus on giving them the right to resources that are hindering them from developing. The U.S takes advantage of Third World countries by dumping landfills and polluting the ecosystems around less developed areas. 
       <br><br>
 I agree that one of the documentary’s biggest strengths is the use of personal opinions and facts about the importance of fighting against climate change. Each person that DiCaprio meets throughout the film shares their opinion and reasons why everyone should be paying attention to climate change. These reasons were “cold hard facts” or very personal accounts of how climate change impacted their lives. By using pathos, the documentary is pulling at the audience’s heartstrings and indirectly impacting our view on the existence and impacts of climate change.




 </span></div><hr>
<p>
Before the Flood is a decent introduction to the issue of climate change, about as good as could be done in only 90 minutes. The film starts with a number of visuals to help show the effects of climate change before diving into the science, causes, and solutions to it. These help keep a perhaps skeptical viewer engaged with examples like holding out 30 feet of robe over Greenland, the thickness of ice lost in the past five years (at time of filming), or the massive fields of oil sands. 

       <br><br>

Then, the documentary gets into one of the core issues: the faux-debate over climate change. Corporate interests have caused confusion over the issue of climate change: they appeal to authority by paying off people with big credentials, when the 97% consensus that climate change is real and human caused is the true indicator of where the scientific community stands. The Koch brothers in particular stood out to me, since they are privately owned, not a corporation at all. The Koch brothers have been offered to sell their company and/or offer it to the public, which has benefited countless other companies, so why wouldn't they? The simple reason is privacy, and with that a lack of accountability to outsiders or the public when there are no shareholders. They can therefore operate in the shadows, working their countless industries that affect all aspects of our lives, while funding institutions that sound academic but in fact are 'think-tanks' that scrounge for evidence to back a set conclusion instead of creating conclusions from all the evidence available. 

       <br><br>

The next part is where the film really hits its stride: after the film shows an immense push for green energy by China, Narain keeps it real. She notes the tough truth that coal is cheap, and that's why developing countries use it. Mass adoption of renewable energy is a luxury very few countries can afford, and it's effectiveness is diminishing despite better technologies when population is increasing and the per capita consumption increases as well. There are several factors that increase each person's consumption, most notably cultural habits, like car culture (taking cars for even the shortest trips), air travel, centering all meals on meat, and others. When DiCaprio brought up the neoliberal perspective that better solar/wind technology will solve the issue in the US, Narain kept shaking her head for good reason. Her perspective, from a country that primarily still uses biomass to cook vegetarian meals, is that a lifestyle change is required in the US and similarly developed nations. 

       <br><br>

Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film to me, however, was the emphasis on switching to a plant-based diet, which has been shown to (besides reducing overall waste) be the most effective way to combat climate change. Again, the cultural perspective instead of the neoliberal perspective is shown. Beef has been ingrained in American culture, but if Americans want to reduce their emissions, it needs to be cut drastically. When the carbon tax was brought up, this was merely a higher level (government) method of achieving the same desired result: considerable changes in the lifestyles of Americans in favor of less emissions. Theoretically, a carbon tax would make beef far more expensive than poultry, and especially more than fruits and vegetables. When considering the economic costs of climate change that Well's brought up, the taxpayer cost of a carbon tax may be a perfectly reasonable approach to reduce demand for the devastating American lifestyle.

While I appreciate Al Gore's hard work and lifelong journey as an ambassador for the environment, I found that "An Inconvenient Sequel" focuses mainly on Al Gore's journey himself, rather than actually about the environment and how we the audience are able to make an impact. After each segment in the film regarding a natural catastrophe or dark prediction, it immediately cut back to Gore himself at a training session or meeting with other political officials. This idea can be exemplified in the film's beginning and ending, when he discusses the creation if the Discovery satellite. He describes how he helped encourage the development of the program, and then how Bush and the following republican administration attempted to prevent it from being launched, and then finally how the project was successful. While the root of this story was environmentally motivated, it focused more on Gore than it did environmental problems and solutions. While a counterpoint could be made that the purpose of this is to establish Gore's credibility since he is not a scientist, I believe that this wasn't necessary. Gore has already established himself in his first film, as well as his political achievements and his Nobel Peace Prize. The character building storyline arc detracted from the urgent tone that the film was trying to portray. The film was tastefully made, and the segment following Gore through the negotiations with India and the success of the Paris Agreement was quite inspiring. However, I didn't find it to be as effective as Before the Flood. While Before the Flood did spend a lot of time establishing DiCaprio's credibility, this was necessary because of his past role as an actor, and people may be skeptical of his credibility as a climate activist. However, the film was able to establish his credibility as well as accurately describe the climate crisis and urge the audience to take part in the fight to mitigate or even reverse global warming and consumerism.

I completely agree. When I watched “Before the Flood”, it never felt like it was about DiCaprio even though it followed his journey to become more informed on the climate crisis. However as you stated, “An Inconvenient Sequel” seemed more like a story about a “hero” for climate change. Al Gore is shown to be an advocate for change but rarely talks about actual changes we the people can make. In the movie all he really ever discusses is renewable energy but as we have learned, simply changing to renewable energy will not make a significant enough change. As you said, whenever the movie was building up the emotion and desire to help, suddenly Al Gore would come in and talk about something else. Although I did like the movie, I feel as though it was unsuccessful because it didn’t really feel like a documentary about the Climate Crisis but about Al Gore instead. For instance, he shows the tragedies that the Philippines and Syria have experienced but offers no solution, simply the cause and how he is working hard to tell people that. The film also fails to include ways for the viewer to become involved. I know some documentaries only aim to inform the viewer about the climate crisis, but Al Gore has already achieved that in his first film. The film “An Inconvenient Truth” served as a wake-up call so the sequel should have instead educated the viewers on how we can actually fix the problem. The ending of the film encourages the citizens to make a difference, but there is no real information given to the audience on how to do just that. So although the movie was nice, I have to say "Before the Flood" was better because it was actually about climate change.

Before the Flood: I found DiCaprio to be a good explorational surrogate for the viewer as he is a recognisable face and name. It was helpful to the understanding of the topics and arguments presented that his platform had been well established through western media. I also appreciated that he was humble about how he came into the position and the push back that he underwent from news outlets like Fox. I found that it was difficult to follow the severity of the problem. I felt that some interviewees viewed the issue as dire and disastrous where the best we could hope for would be damage control and others seemed to hope for better. It was encouraging to see the moments of global progress such as China's constant resistance or Sweden's complete shift away from fossil fuels, but it was also despairing to compare these images to what I know about what the USA and the current government has done more recently to subvert this progress. 
       <br><br>


Regarding the rhetorical device used by DiCaprio to bring the audience alongside him on his journey of research and discovery; I believe it is a powerful tool used especially in persuasive documentaries. I have most often seen this tactic in documentaries regarding food in health or in environmental consequences such as the recent Game Changers or on the other end Supersize Me. This method by which we, the viewers, can embark on an experience with the maker of the film allows the information and topics to become more personal and therefore more impactful.



</p><hr>

<p>
The method employed in the film Before the Flood is effective because it allows someone who is unaware of the effects of climate change to see how people around the world feel about climate change and how climate change is affecting those people.  Though we are able to read papers published by scientists that explain how climate change is affecting us, if we do not understand the paper or if we just see the papers as something boring that we have to read, we will not be motivated to take action against climate change.  Through the film, the audience can see that carbon emissions are melting glaciers, killing coral reefs, flooding crops that people depend on, and other devastating effects of the changing conditions.
       <br><br>

As demonstrated in the film, it is the poor of the world that experience the effects of climate change the most.  It is also the poor of the world that are unable to do anything against climate change, as they need to be focused on more immediate issues that affect them personally, such as getting electricity and food.  Conversely, the wealthy of the world need not concern themselves with issues such as food shortages, because if food becomes scarce and expensive, they can still afford it.  Even today, though some people are at risk of losing their homes due to flooding, those with money can just buy a new house elsewhere.  Thus, the people who are suffering from climate change are unable to do anything against it, while the people who have the ability to take action are unwilling to do so, or are unaware of how devastating climate change is.  
       <br><br>

This film appeals to people whose lives have not yet been devastated by climate change.  These people need to be made aware of the world’s current condition so that they can be spurred into taking action before it is too late to fix what humanity has done.

I also think that watching a movie like this one is actually a very effective way to educate people and raise their awareness about the climate problem since with all the pictures, videos/recordings, interviews,etc really helped us to get deeper to know what the issue really is. 
       <br><br>
And I also agree with the thing you mentioned that the poor are always the group that are helpless and suffer the most facing such and environmental crisis and there is no way they can do anything against the situation they are facing. And there is one point I want to mention is that no matter how many policies/laws or agreements are being made, if no one take real actions to tackle the problem, the issue will never get solved and the one who are going to suffer the outcome is each of us on the earth.

Before the Flood: Throughout this film, I was in utter despair at the fact that our daily actions are tipping earth over the edge of disaster. Professor Jason E. Box explained to Leonardo that the hose at the climate station in Greenland was 30 feet under ice but now it has melted out and that idea was hard for me to grasp. All that ice is now in the ocean, adding up to the sea level rise. What angers me the most is that the data and evidence is there, yet certain politicians still don’t believe that global warming is real. This is a dangerous thing because these politicians have the power to create policies to protect the environment, yet they don’t because wealthy industries bribe them with so much money. As a result, some Americans are influenced to also believe that global warming isn’t real. Also, in the film, DiCaprio is interviewing Gidon Eshel, a PH.D scientist who studies the effects of agriculture, Gidon claims that by changing our diet to less meat consumption could aid in the decline of tropical deforestation and reduce our carbon print. Hence, we could be looking forward to a more vegetarian/vegan society. I do agree that a plant-based diet is a good way to face this issue of climate change, however now we also have to think of the possible effects that this solution may cause. A plant-based diet may, fortunately, increase the lifespan of humans due to healthy food consumption and thus a stronger immune system, less diseases. The problem then will be a higher increase in human population than before because people are going to out live their life expectancy. This piles to the issue of overpopulation and the need for more resources is still going to be very present. Although, the benefits of a plant-based diet does outweigh the consequences and, as for right now, this change of diet could help us decrease our carbon footprint. Furthermore, in the film Leonardo DiCaprio visits Sumatra, Indonesia were he witnesses a forest on fire that was set intentionally for the creation of palm oil plantations. This fire reminded me of the current menacing fire going on in Australia. This fire has been going on for a while now and just recently the world is finally paying attention to its devastating results. Wildlife is decreasing and the emission of carbon dioxide is rapidly growing. Even though the fires could be stopped the impact is already there, all the release of carbon dioxide is getting trapped into the atmosphere. 

       <br><br>


Also, Ken’s lecture is correct on the fact that not everyone wants to know the truth behind climate change. It is understandable that there are many crisis going around the world at the same time so climate change might not seem too serious to certain people. However, by taking a step back and observing how floods, fires, and hurricanes have been getting worse each year, it is obvious that something is not right. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job at presenting how climate change is affecting various parts of the world differently. He acknowledges that even though he isn’t an expert in this topic, he does have the passion and the curiosity to learn more about global warming and what he can do to help. The fact that DiCaprio is a well known artist with a solid fanbase, this film helps to spread more awareness to different audiences and even other celebrities and thus more people are exposed to the reality of climate change.

Before the Flood: After watching the film, I am completely in the same boat as you. I find it so impressive that the little things that we do or the lifestyle we follow can have such a large impact on the climate crisis. For me personally, it was surprising when they were speaking of how much of an impact the amount of beef that one eats has on the climate crisis. I personally consume a lot of beef, I would say more than the average person, therefore this came as a big surprise to me. I would even take it as far as saying that after watching this film it has made me strongly consider to make a change in my diet, in order to do my part to fight the climate crisis.


<br><hr>
In response to both Alicia and Priscilla, I believe they are correct. When watching the film, “Before the Flood,” I was overcome with the same emotions both of these two expressed. The film did make me heavily think about the natural disasters that have occurred, especially the fires in Australia which they mentioned. While Priscilla noted that the fires have been going on for awhile now, I would say I would be a hypocrite in that I too only recently started paying attention to them.
<br><br>
 The film ignited a hatred towards the U.S. that I had not felt before. DiCaprio visited tons of countries yet the one country creating the most damage was doing the least to make a change. It made me embarrassed to be a contributing factor to that arrogance. The woman from India was the most inspiring, as I admired the way she questioned DiCaprio. Every point she made really made me second guess the United States and their role. 
<br><br>
Overall, “Before the Flood,” made me reconsider my diet most. There were such simple solutions promoted to one of the biggest problems. For example, eating chicken as opposed to cows and beef would help the decrease the CO2 emissions immensely.  That is an easy fix. When I was in high school, my Environmental Science teacher refused to eat Palm Oil. When asked why, he would tell the class that eventually we would learn. I have now. Cutting out products from the big corporations that use Palm Oil, such as Kraft, would drastically help the environment and the orangutans. In the film, they also suggested a carbon tax. Many of the people we put in congress are endorsed by the companies using the most fossil fuels. Consequently, a carbon tax will never be passed. Learning all of this made me very upset. Though the film showed many horrible sites, personally I was most triggered by the scenes in Miami. As professor Kiltner also said in the lecture video, there will be sunny days where the streets are flooded. That is not normal. The mayor also remarked in the film how their budget is being spent on raising the streets and creating pumps. I do not think that is a lasting solution but a temporary one. The United States must make a change.

In the movie "before the flood", it is also a topic that we often hear in recent years. People collect a lot of oil and coal resources, consume a lot of meat products, which leads to a large amount of carbon dioxide and methane output. The global temperature rises, the climate is abnormal, coral reefs die, Arctic glaciers begin to melt, and sea level rises. This film is mainly about these themes. Leonardo DiCaprio expressed what he saw and thought after he went to many countries. One of the most influential women in this movie is an Indian woman who said that Americans live a happy life, but now they want developing countries like India to use green energy. The film also shows the hard life of the local residents, even the simple daily life can not be satisfied, of course, there is no condition to use green energy. The film also shows a very good problem, that is, the development of each country is different. In order to develop, poor countries will collect and use a lot of fossil energy. In a country that destroys the environment and develops itself, I think everyone will choose the latter. In my opinion, it is a better choice to levy a carbon emission tax than to call on people to live a low-carbon life with morality. Everyone knows the importance of low-carbon environmental protection because most people know that global warming and climate change are caused by human activities. But in daily life, people often don't care so much. But I think this film is very good for me to show my views on the climate crisis in different countries, and also give me a new view of the environmental crisis and climate change.

I’m happy that you also appreciated the message being pushed by the woman from India. The United states’ carbon footprint is larger per capita than any other country. A transition away from fossil fuels should be implemented within America in order to not only reduce our own carbon footprint. Possibly more importantly, we would help set a precedent of what a developed nation’s energy source should strive to be. Countries like china have already put far more stake in renewable energies such as solar and wind. I agree that levying a carbon tax would help reduce emissions especially within the highly developed counties. If we rely on people to give up cheap energy in favor of a greener future, we must incentivize them to change.
<br><br>
I personally believe that making DiCaprio the spokesperson for climate change was a good idea. Although Leo admits his carbon footprint is likely larger than a majority of individuals, his outspoken support of the movement and his passionate speeches resonate with those who watch it. He may not technically be an expert on climate change, but with all of the information he has come across from reputable scientific sources as well as seeing first hand the damage being caused due to climate change. Casting Leo as the candidate for the climate crisis. The damage being done to the planet including the ice caps, coral reefs ocean PH etc... cannot be allowed to continue. The call to action proposed in “Before The Flood”, a tax on carbon emissions, is a good start to addressing ways to reduce our consumption of fossil fuels and hopefully, move on to a more renewable source of energy. However, I find myself thinking that even if a tax was levied and people began to use electronic cars, the problem of the CO2 already present in the atmosphere and the continuous outflow of products such as clothing will continue to pollute the earth’s atmosphere. Until a cultural revolution which prioritizes a clean carbon footprint is implemented, we will still be moving ever closer to potential catastrophe.

I respect Leonardo DiCaprio for trying to raise awareness and bring about action for global warming. Although he is obviously not an expert on this issue, which he acknowledges, he is taking an important step for the future of our nation. He even admits to not knowing a lot of information about global warming, which I think is an effective rhetorical device because he probably knows more than it appears. I think this could serve as an example to others that it is not necessary to specifically study environmental change in order to try and help it.
<br><br>
I was shocked when Dr. Sala said that in “2040, you will be able to sail over the North Pole.” Even though I know that the polar ice caps are melting, this specific piece of information helped me realize how quickly these changes are occurring. In my opinion, this emphasizes how important it is for politicians to take action; climate change is an issue regardless of political party. It frustrates me that people and the media continue to claim that global warming is not occurring or has not been affected by humans. Dr. Michael E. Mann stated that 97% of scientists agree that global warming is caused by human activity, and yet, people continue to argue against its existence. It makes sense that corporations, especially fossil fuel industries, are motivated against efforts that will help the environment but harm their companies, but I still think there must be a change. Considering our current government though, with 131 climate change deniers in Congress, it is almost impossible to pass bills that are necessary to end the damaging effects from climate change, and I find this very frustrating.

I agree with you in that this film uses Leonardo DiCaprio as a great example to show that you do not need to be an environmental expert in order to care about the climate crisis. His large following gives him a massive platform and the ability to reach, educate, and inspire so many people on this topic. However I do feel like DiCaprio’s fame may take away some legitimacy from the film for some climate change skeptics. Having the lead person in the documentary have such a lack of scientific training and knowledge may cause those who already think climate change is “fake” to feel even stronger. Is DiCaprio’s fame and background in acting positive because he can reach more people or negative because his profession has not made him nearly as qualified as scientists and environmentalists to be speaking on such a complex issue?
<br><br>
Regardless of whether or not DiCaprio makes the best lead of this film, the documentary is effective in addressing the climate change crisis and invoking an emotional reaction from the viewers. Due to them going to multiple countries and speaking to real people living there, the documentary reaches a personal level and instead of being overly filled with science and confusing data, it shows how normal people are tragically affected by this everyday. Although numbers and research help prove the severity of this problem, I believe that the way to get the public, and then political leaders, to care and act on this crisis is by exposing the horrible consequences that climate change is bringing to territories today and in the near future. There may always be lobbyists and fossil fuel interests calling this the “greatest hoax of all time” when it fact it is the greatest crisis of all time, but once it feels real and personal to the public, I believe the truth will be found and progressive action will follow.
<br><hr>
I agree with you in the sense that Leonardo sets a great example as an impassioned individual who isn't a refined expert on the issue that tries to make a difference despite his circumstances. Climate change is a global problem, and it can not and will not be solved by only a handful of scientists. People from all walks of life need to recognize the scope of the issue and address it themselves. Putting Leonardo in the spotlight  was a great method of galvanizing ordinary people like us. I believe that more people like Leonardo need to stand up and take action like him  to create the mass movement and social action that needs to happen in order to prompt an appropriate congressional response. I find it disgusting how these white house politicians are essentially accepting bribes from fossil fuel companies. I also find it confusing how such a large number of climate change skeptics can exist. Not only are there 131 climate change deniers in congress, but there are also thousands if not millions of people that helped vote them into office that believe the same way.
<br><br>
I like how this film brings this fact into the public view. Many people are unaware of the ridiculous amount of influence that the fossil fuel companies and lobbyists have over our politicians. I can only hope that immediate change is taken now so that less people will have to suffer as a result of their corruption.

<br><hr>
I think you are right in the way that his fame could have both positive and negative effects. I think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, though, because there is so much research on climate change through legitimate scientists, and yet people still don't believe in it. Leonardo DiCaprio, although not an expert, is a famous public figure, and people tend to trust well-known celebrities, even if they might not be the most educated on a topic.

The film, “An Inconvenient Sequel”, is Al Gore’s second video addressing the critique he had received for his first movie and how climate change is real and getting worse by the year. I think this film was successful at communicating its subject of showing the troublesome effects of climate change in just the past decade. The show was very well put together with first person videos of the different climates around the world and the effect. Starting with Greenland it showed the surprisingly fast melting of the ice caps as in 2000 to 2016 twelve meters of ice melted, which then causes sea levels to rise flooding the streets of Miami, Florida. I think that the target audience was the people who doubted Gore’s credibility and those who wanted to learn more about climate change. My general reaction to this film was I thought it was crazy that big fossil fuel companies were paying people to discredit climate change and that Gore had to promise India solar power or else they would not sign the Paris Agreement. 
<br><br>

I learned from the film that there is a new satellite that went up into the world in 2016 that circles around the world and determines the changes through the satellite. This film was very interesting especially because in 2019 President Trump came and took America out of the Paris Agreement. This is very sad but also it is very exciting to know that California is taking initiative and still in the Paris Agreement. Al Gore wants the world to switch to 100 percent renewable energy I think that can be accomplished. I feel more optimistic after watching the film because more people are understanding climate change is a real thing and want to help keep the Earth healthy. I would definitely recommend this movie to others because it is very interesting and encourages individual participants.

I agree fully with what you stated here seeing how effective Al Gore's film, "The Inconvenient Sequel", reveals to the world the devastating effects that the climate crisis is having on our planet, already. For many years, Al Gore has been a major power figure in the climate crisis awareness across the globe and reveals that here even after his time as vice president has passed, that his power in influence is still effective as he was able to get Solar-city, a major solar company compromised here in the United States to come along and help India with a compromise in the Paris Agreement in 2015. 

<br><br>
Yet, this isn't the major factor of the film as the film itself does a fantastic job showing the effect of climate change on the planet and those it is greatly effecting as we seen in Tacloban City in the Philippines, New York city and Miami in the United States, Syria and it's drought and many others. The use of first hand footage showing these occurrences devastating the lives of the people in conjunction with Gore going and reaching out to those hurt by these climate side occurrences brings to light the broader side of climate change we do not see here in the United States as we are unaware of the consequences else where in the world. Seeing such devastation makes an emotional push within me that wants to change the world for the better and feel rather optimistic about what we can do with growing technology advancements and better knowledge on the climate crisis as I believe everyone else has. Gore's idea that the planet can go carbon neutral  or at least 100% renewable energy can be a possibility if we can get the world on board about climate change and create better relations internationally by leading the United States down as a leading figure, even if Trump pulled us out of the agreement, states like our own, California and towns like Georgetown in the film show that we can take the initiative, even if were not in on the agreement. 
<br><br>

Now seeing both films, "Before the Flood" in English 22 and now "The Inconvenient Sequel", they both take on different approaches whilst being around the same time period. Where these too diverge is that Leonardo is aiming understanding the effects and deeper truth behind the climate change by going to places impacted by the climate change like Kiribati, India and the arctic. While, Al Gore shows us the governmental side and his initiative in trying to make the world a better place through training those around the world on climate change, especially in effected regions. Yet, in the end of both of them, it leaves me optimistic about the power we have in changing the planet for the better and for more renewable energy all across the globe.

I think what Leo is doing is admirable, and these kinds of films definitely help in "alarming" people about the climate challenges facing humanity. Documentaries like before the flood, with the backing of very popular people with millions of followers, help bring more people on board with the movement to save our planet.
<br><br>

The film definitely seems a little rushed. I would have liked it to talk more about consumerism, and about food production and consumption, animal products etc. I recognize that the point of the film is more an introduction and overview of the crisis rather than a full-fledged encyclopedia on it, and on that front I think the film is pretty successful.
<br><br>

What I also found very effective in the film is the cinematography. Leo takes us on a journey around the world, to all these beautiful places that are under siege by the thirst of man. It is a reminder of how lucky we are to be living on such an astonishing planet, amongst all these interesting and wonderful creatures. The destruction is brought into stark contrast with these beauty, and all of a sudden the fragility of these precious ecosystems becomes obvious. The decimated forests, the homeless and motherless apes, the beauty and destruction is all there to be seen in, coinciding in the same frame in a way that they never should. Suddenly, the vanity of all this becomes clear, through pictures, and I think this is the most effective aspect of the film.

MAIN POINT:<br><br>

If I were to criticize something, it is that the film fails to dig under the surface a little bit, to provide a more seasoned perspective of what actually and realistically needs to happen to curb climate change. When talking to the Indian lady, Leo says that overconsumption will be solved by renewable energy. I think this approach is totally wrong. New systems have to be put into place to help make consumption much more efficient and effective, including curbing our food waste and animal consumption. An interesting point is that it would be more beneficial to keep your existing car if it is healthy and in good shape, rather than go buy an electric one, since the CO2 emitted to produce it is more than would be saved by driving an electric car (even assuming that electricity comes from renewables - which it definitely doesn't). These are the kinds of arguments people need to hear to understand to gain real perspective and insight into energy cycles, CO2 emission production, and ultimately climate change.
<br><br>

Unfortunately I have not come across many such documentaries, articles, and certainly not in this course as of yet. Hopefully we will see some soon!

I agree with your stance that the film seems a bit rushed, as a full length film could be made on each of the stops Leo made (Indonesia, Canada, Greenland, etc). I think the film's whirlwind nature and alarmist stance could have one of two effects on people: scaring them away into apathy or mobilizing them into action. The film is meant as an introduction to may different climate related issues, so the rushed nature may have been necessary. The use of Leo as the protagonist/host of the film also serves to show that you don't need to be a climate scientist or environmental professional to be educated and passionate about the climate crisis. Granted Leo is a millionaire and can afford to travel all over the world in pursuit of climate truths, but the information is generally accessible to the public.
<br><br>

I think your main criticism of the film is fair, particularly your point about Leo's discussion with the Indian climate minister. He tended to say blanket statements that don't apply to everywhere in the world, not taking into account the differences in economy, geography, and infrastructure that make certain solutions harder to implement in different places. What particularly stood out to me was when the minister called out Leo by saying that HIS consumption and that of the USA is causing issues for the rest of the world. It is for this reason I find it disheartening that the US is not taking the reins in developing sustainable technologies when we are amongst the largest polluters in the world. I think a good accompaniment/response to this film would be one in which systematic solutions are explored. Such a film could focus on the points you laid out (food waste, animal consumption, energy systems) instead of very surface level, popular environmentalism (using less plastic, consuming less, etc). These actions are not unimportant, but using a tote bag instead of a plastic bag at Whole Foods isn't going to stop the climate from changing.
<br><hr>
 thanks for your reply. Yes exactly!
<br><br>

I think your identification of the purpose and audience of this film is spot-on, it's basically a climate crisis 101 for the masses (lol). I guess, even knowing this, my frustration stems from the fact that each and everyone of us should know much more about climate change than the "101" spiel, since it is such an important topic and it requires actions on all levels from government and big tech to society mobilizing to drive the people making the decisions to take action. In essence I believe films like these are "old-fashioned" - people need to know much more than the basics, and they should know the basics by now (wishful thinking I know).
<br><br>

Regarding my second point, this is exactly my frustration, I see a lot of pseudo-activists out there trying to make themselves feel slightly better by doing this nitty-gritty tasks like using whole foods paper bags, when they are eating meat, over-consuming, and in general are totally out of touch with what will actually make a difference.
<br><br>

If we are to solve this we need to get serious about how and why we are changing the climate. Thanks again for your great response.

I agree with Ken that the Film "An Inconvenient Sequel" establishes Al Gore's credibility in regards to climate change. On the the main issues that people had when Al Gore's first film was released was that Al Gore wasn't a scientist what does he know about climate change, which then was not as prominent of and idea or issue as it is today. "An Inconvenient Sequel" uses what has happened in the years past to build Gore's credibility as many of the things he predicted in the first film ended up occurring within the last decade.  I would say the film spends half of it's time reestablishing Gore's credibility and why he is a good spokesperson for climate change and the other half of the time it details the intricacies of policy and economics that go into establishing infrastructure to combat climate change.

In regards to the Paris conflict that takes place in the film I think India's leaders did have a very good reason behind why they wanted to used coal as they stated they felt cheated. As the Western world who used coal to establish infrastructure and build a solid economy, is now telling them that they can't do the same because essentially these already developed countries have maxed out on CO2 deposits in the atmosphere preventing other nations from using cheap coal to advance their own societies. While the argument that India presented is logically sound and the Western world is hypocritical in this sense, we are still right in that we can't afford to produce more CO2 into the atmosphere as the world is at stake and what good is advancing a nation if it only last for 30 years?

I completely agree with both responses. The film in my opinion as well split into creating credibility, but also showing the work that Gore has been able to do. Before watching this, I had no knowledge that Al Gore had such a large part in the efforts for climate change; especially regarding the Paris agreement.

In regards to the Paris agreement, I agree with you as well that India's leaders had every reason to believe that they should be able to give energy to all of the people living in their country using the same methods the US has for over 150 years. This is similar to Before the Flood when other leaders are looking to the US to be the first to make a change rather than pointing the blame to other countries. I was glad to see they were able to agree in the end, but I worry that the time it takes to make the change could be far longer than we can afford for it to be.

With the US pulling out of the Paris Agreement, what does that show to the hundreds of other nations that look to us as one of the strongest nations in the World. It is very worrisome to me that our President can simply back out that easily.
